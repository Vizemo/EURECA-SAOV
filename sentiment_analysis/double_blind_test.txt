{"comment": "This has been on my mind a lot lately.  We live in a suburb that’s becoming rapidly more populated.  I’m a teacher and all three of my kids go to different schools, so we get hit with tons of germs.  I think the most likely disease we’ll deal with is flu, but I’m worried about a strain that isn’t covered by the vaccine and spreads quickly. Besides what you said, for me, a lot of the prep is nutrition related.  I stock multivitamins, probiotics, vitamin c, etc.  And we try to eat healthy and stress hand washing. Also, I’m willing to pull my kids out of school and stay home if I see an epidemic emerging.  I think prevention is the best strategy.", "score": 21, "subreddit": "preppers"}

The testing for it isnt even accurate as its not that great of an indicator seeing as how the status of a person can change from negative to positive.China is now up to 40 different strains of the virus and thats overwhelming as hell. To keep that contained is a whole other matter if people start flying back and forth for business-related travel.

{"comment": "Thanks for the reply, very interesting. \n\nWe are 3 years away from an election and in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic, so I would expect Labour campaigning to ramp up, but only after summer 2021, when we hope a vaccine will be pushed out to the population. \n\nOnce the dust settles and the ineptness of the Conservative strategy is laid bare, Labour can be more vocal and engage with the public without the risk of being accused of exploiting the pandemic for political reasons. That would play right into the government's hands, and as we can see from Boris, he is utilising Trumpian tactics, smearing the opposition repeatedly and desperately instead of answering any challenging questions. However that can come across as inept, and a vulnerability, I.e he has no counter argument so talks shite.\n\nI digress. The point is, do not give Boris ammunition to smear you because it's his entire back up plan in case the government loses credibility. Like now.\n\nNo doubt Starmer will have a good long think about how to expose incompetence whilst not leaving the party open to the same fatal assault Corbyns Labour suffered.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "ukpolitics"}

{"comment": "The Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines work by injecting the body with the mRNA used to synthesise the protein on the outside of the coronavirus 'ball' (basically a recipe for the protein, NOT the virus) your body sees this new piece of mRNA and thinks 'alright, lets try this out' and makes the protein.\n\nYour body then realises the protein is not something that belongs in your body and your immune system kicks into gear to figure out how to destroy this protein. At this stage you may feel slightly unwell, headaches, fever, fatigue etc, this is NOT because you have the coronavirus, but because your immune system is in overdrive. Once it figures out how to destroy this protein it will do so. \n\nThen in future, if you were to be exposed to coronavirus your immune system would immediately recognise the protein sticking out of it (which is how the virus interacts with your body) and immediately starts producing whatever it figured out destroyed the protein when you had the vaccine. Once the proteins on the outside of the virus are destroyed, the virus cannot interact with your body and make you fall ill. It basically just floats around unable to do anything until your body figures out a way to destroy it, like with the protein earlier.", "score": 7, "subreddit": "entitledparents"}
