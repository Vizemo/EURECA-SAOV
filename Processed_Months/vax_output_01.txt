{"comment": "Here's my full thoughts.\n\nScout Primary: **Soda Popper/Shortstop**. Scout's primary is only for chip damage to Tanks and for picking off Snipers. SS is better at long-range Sniper duty and its push ability can sometimes be used to reset the bomb when not running a Pyro, while SP's ability is great for getting money in tight situations (robots are horrible at shooting jumping scouts). Personal preference. FaN causes more problems than it fixes.\n\nScout Secondary: **Milk** always, non-negotiable. Health on hit is too useful for the team and scales with your teammates's damage upgrades. The slow is also very important against giant Scouts.\n\nScout Melee: **FoW**. Sandman is too expensive just to get the same ability as FoW, and it can still only mark one target. Just a pointless downgrade; a Scout never needs to mark a target they can't reach, since the team will be focusing targets they *can* reach.\n\nSoldier primary: **Stock/Beggar's**. Not sure what you're on about w.r.t beggar's, people use it all the time and it's fantastic at overall damage. The main reason to use stock is for more flexibility and better range, but at close distance beggar's is a powerhouse. Air Strike paired with BASE is okay late-game, but it needs a lot of upgrades to be viable and you're generally better-served by stock or beggar's.\n\nSoldier secondary: **Buff** always unless pairing with multiple soldiers, in which case Buff, then Conch, then Backup.\n\nSoldier melee: **Whip** if your engie is unreliable about functioning teleporters, otherwise **escape plan** for retreating to packs.\n\nPyro primary: **Stock/phlog**. Phlog for tanks, Stock at all other times. DF is an okay sidegrade to stock but it isn't as flexible and its airblast cooldown is killer. Remember, as Pyro your duty is to either slaughter tanks, or play god with the battlefield, resetting bombs whenever possible and keeping bots back when your team starts to get overwhelmed. The DF tries to be a jack of all trades but ends up being worse at both.\n\nPyro secondary: **Gas Passer** is almost non-negotiable. Flare gun is nice for picking off long-range Snipers if your team doesn't have someone else doing that job (soldier, scout), but really, GP all the way, especially if you're taking out tanks; you get gas constantly and just tossing it near the tank means you don't need to ever worry about bots around the tank.\n\nPyro melee: **Homewrecker** always. Speed upgrades negate the need for powerjack, and every second counts with sappers.\n\nDemo primary: **Iron Bomber** is much more reliable when it comes to spread compared to stock. Bouncing pipes means they instantly become rollers, which do pointless damage in MvM. IB means you can reliably take out Snipers with just a few projectile speed upgrades (which are dirt cheap).\n\nDemo secondary: **SR/stock**. This one comes down to preference; I personally hate the arm delay on the SR so I always use Stock as I feel it allows me to be more responsive to emerging threats (giant Scouts that we failed to kill). SR does offer higher burst damage, so paired with a Kritz medic (in Two Shitties or Decoy Wave 5) that can be useful, but otherwise, no.\n\nDemo melee: **Stock/eyelander**. You will always die in melee range to bots, so you should be running to packs rather than blowing yourself up. Your respawn timer is too long to afford that. Eyelander can give you a constant health + move speed buff if you take out just a few weak bots early on with it, otherwise just use stock so you can get a crit and survive.\n\nHeavy primary: **BB/stock**. HLH means you can never be away from a dispenser and the fire damage it puts out is pitiful. It also doesn't catch spies before they stab you, so it's useless. BB puts out the most damage and the lack of damage upgrades for miniguns means it's a huge DPS amount in the early game, but stock provides better mobility/flexibility - a heavy with move speed upgrades + stock can quickly reposition if the need arises, like to block a giant Scout if the Sentry falls.\n\nHeavy secondary: **Sandvich/banana**, sandvich helps a single teammate more while the banana can help multiple teammates. Personal preference.\n\nHeavy melee: **GRU/FoS**. You should already have resists, so I always run GRU to get back to the front line faster if the tele is down.\n\nEngie primary: **RR/Homewrecker**. Homewrecker can be very useful against Tanks if the engie isn't needed elsewhere, but if all of your time is spent with your sentry then RR for repositioning. This sort of depends on the map/your team and I switch between both.\n\nEngie secondary: **Short circuit/wrangler**. Wrangler is great for all-around damage (and its shield for tanking against giants), but SC is definitely useful against certain waves, like the crit pill demos in expert.\n\nEngie Melee: **Jag/stock**, you should probably be running stock in most scenarios but in Expert the jag can be very useful, since money is often very tight and you can't afford to always pop a canteen.\n\nMedic primary: **Crossbow** is too useful to suggest anything else. The other primaries can be fun to dick around with if you've got a competent team, but the CC is the de-facto standard.\n\nMedic secondary: **Kritz/stock/QF**. Because shield rate is based on heal rate, QF can get shields up faster, but otherwise it's mostly useless. Stock provides decent survivability against certain waves when you won't always have a shield. Kritz is great to have in long staggered waves like in Two Cities, but often pointless in Expert; tank pyros should always be popping phlog so there's no point boosting them, demos don't need crit traps like they do in 2C, and using kritz on heavies doesn't make up for the potential damage your player slot is worth on another class. Really only decent when paired with Ubersaw on a very talented medic, in Expert at least. Vaxx is no longer used because they fixed the bug awhile ago where you could basically get instant rezzes with its mini-ubers.\n\nMedic melee: **Ubersaw** always; nothing else is useful in MvM since amputator's healing is worthless against medigun upgrades, and vita-saw is useless thanks to boosted uber rates.\n\nSniper primary: **Heatmaker or Sleeper** always. Obviously Heatmaker is the best for chaining constant explosive headshots, but people rule out the Sleeper all the time when they shouldn't. While it can't technically deal headshot damage, shooting bots in the head still causes explosive headshots, and that does full damage to surrounding bots. It also covers every bot caught in the explosion with jarate, which can be paired with the jarate slow upgrade for a surprisingly competent weapon combo. Newer players should stay off of Sniper though, and even competent ones should probably stick to Heatmaker.\n\nSniper secondary: **Very open-ended**. Jarate is a requirement so you can get the slow upgrade to pair with Sleeper, but I personally really like the Camper since it has a constant +4/s heal in mvm (compared to the crit heal mechanic in stock tf2), and the lack of flinching is very very useful for getting that initial headshot (which you can then chain). Carbine can also pair with Bush against tanks when you lack a Buff Banner.\n\nSniper melee: **Stock** almost always, but Bushwacka is surprisingly competent against tanks if you have a Soldier using Buff. Otherwise stick to Stock for its constant 'random' crits.\n\n**Don't discount Spy**. It definitely plays weirdly, but once you gain enough experience in MvM and can predict exactly how bots move and react, Spy can be pretty decent. Spy's main purpose is almost always going to be dealing with giant Medics, so that's what my recommendations are based around.\n\nSpy primary: **L'etranger**, spy guns are always useless and that doesn't change in mvm, might as well have extra cloak. You won't be stabbing a bunch of small bots so Diamondback is useless, and all other guns suck for what you should be doing: killing giants.\n\nSpy secondary: **Dead ringer**, cloak is useless because bots can track you when you're cloaked, but DR can give you a burst of resistance for a little while, which is enough time to break line of sight which is what bots care about when tracking disguises. Pair with l'etranger for a longer resist period.\n\nSpy melee: **Big Earner**. Stock is okay, but there's no reason not to use BE. Spycicle means even a slight brush with fire puts you out of combat, which is killer for a time-critical pick class. YER is useless because bots can see through disguises and YER doesn't reset their tracking. Kunai is useless because you're lowering your base health for no reason; you can already get health on kill on all knives with upgrades.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "truetf2"}

I found out soon after that I was pregnant, and my babydaddy and I moved in together into a 4 bedroom house.\nSince then, Babydaddy has had Shop (old collie, died last Xmas), Party (another old collie rescue who died over the summer), and Ros\u00e9, a puppy he adopted a few weeks ago.\nOur toddler is almost 3. We are both dog industry people so she\u2019s around other dogs a lot. When Babydaddy adopted Ros\u00e9 a few weeks ago I told him explicitly that I would still want to adopt a puppy of my own. He agreed that was fine.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with his puppy. But I\u2019ve been waiting since my dog died to find another like him, and now I have. I found a beautiful fully vaxxed &amp; potty trained young dog and want to bring him home in a few days.\nNow all of a sudden friends are telling me I\u2019m an asshole for trying to bring another dog into the house and that it\u2019s \u201cnot fair to [babydaddy] or [toddler]\u201d.\nI\u2019ve never fussed about the dogs Babydaddy has brought into our home and I\u2019ve made it clear for over two years that I would one day get my own dog companion. It\u2019s frustrating to me to have the funds, the means, the dream dog in the wings, and a willing partner and kid \u2014 only to be called an asshole for wanting this.\nI love his dog too but he picked her out and is raising her as his little minion. My friend says I\u2019m an asshole for not loving her as my own dog instead of adopting the other puppy. I understand where that sentiment comes from and generally I agree but there is something special about dogs and their one-on-one human. I miss the wordlessly tight friendship I had with my own dog.\nFor context we have two cats (who have always dealt with dogs in and out of their lives \u2014again, we are both dog industry people with decades of k9 exp) and 3 chickens (separate from other animals, in aviary). One kid. &amp; One puppy. In 4 bedroom house w/ big fenced yard.\nI feel like a bit of a spoiled princess for wanting \u201cmy own dog\u201d but I believe he would prove compatible with Ros\u00e9 and in fact occupy much of her energy and give my toddler a break. Even if he gives me more work and stress I\u2019d welcome it, since I\u2019m not planning to have another human kid.\nMaybe I\u2019m being daft.

Why would anyone medically transition if there weren\u2019t some material basis to sex? That doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nBut again, banned. It feels like some imminent danger is approaching. When you get \u201ccancelled\u201d for believing in reality (jk Rowling) I don\u2019t even know where the world is headed. Could I get fired for believing in biological sex when my career is LITERALLY one as a biologist (note: I do not specialize in sexual dimorphism but am scientifically literate//a published biologist)?\n\nPeople who agree already show support, but those brainwashed to the trans cult immediately get in fight or flight mode and lose all ability to hear. I refuse to debate anyone who isn\u2019t willing to listen. Same goes for me; if I am unwilling to hear the other side there\u2019s no purpose; debate is about learning for me. Being wrong is simply a part of life, and I legitimately wish I could understand what gender means to these people. \n\nFrom the points I\u2019ve seen argued, I will have to stick with the side I\u2019m on: humans are sexually dimorphic. The fact that there are exceptions to biology is simply a fact in every topic out there, especially biology (yeah, it\u2019s a messy subject), but those exceptions to the rule are called \u201coutliers\u201d unknown to TRAs, and they rarely cause a scientist to pull a paper, much less throw away entire paradigms in which we live.\n\nYes, there are circumstances in which someone who is not xx can have a baby (very rare), but from what I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re able to do this through human intervention methods aka not naturally. What I\u2019ve seen regarding bio sex is a ton of half truth \u201cscience\u201d articles and slide show type deals posted. Someone reads a paragraph or a set of bullet points and doesn\u2019t look any further into it. It\u2019s frustrating and feels like the people posting information are purposefully leaving out info to make the point they wish to be correct.\n\nAnyway: TLDR....I\u2019m trying, but without much success. People who argue against sex are brainwashed and go into fight or flight of someone doesn\u2019t share their view of the world. They don\u2019t know how to read primary literature and read simplified, inaccurate versions of reality written at a middle school reading level.", "score": 7, "subreddit": "GenderCritical"}

Even this evening my brother just bursted into my room which i keep telling him to atleast knock and when i asked my mom if she would help me teach him about basic manners not just knocking before entering all she does is tell me to let him do his thing because HeS NoT LiKe uS (something she says to me every time i talk about the things he does because of his autism and sometimes even some basic bad habits).\n\nJust yesterday my mom and brother came into my room and politely asked if I could help them play with my drone which i agreed to when i started it up he said \"brother chase me\" (he talks in english even though we don't live in a country that does) and after a quick game of drone tag my mom told me to teach him how to fly a drone which if youve ever seen a normal kid try to learn how to fly a drone you can imagine how his autism made things even harder. As i sat him down to teach him how to fly it he kept trying to just grab the controller out of my hands, but quickly stopped after a few seconds (believe me when i say this isnt the worst type of behavior I have to live with) and after just a few moments he crashes my 200 euro drone and i quickly grab it so it couldnt get damaged. My mom just said to give it back to him, but after arguing for a little bit over if i should give it to him or not i just asked him if he wants to fly it and he just says no, we started arguing again over if he actually wants to fly it or not as she kept saying he doesnt know what he wants which is kinda true but i can tell when thats the case (which is another thing that annoys me when she acts as if she knows what other people are thinking/feeling). After putting it away i come back get the controller and as i do that i ask him again to make sure if he really doesn't want the drone to which he replies no, after he says that i look over to my mom and she just tells my in an annoyed voice to go away.\n\nSome of the things he does makes me worry about his future, some of the things he does are gross like when he goes to the bathroom he starts to take off his pants before hes inside and he never closes the door which are things if left unchanged will become really bad when he's out in public.\n\nAnother thing he periodically does is hitting people when hes angry even on a few occasions our poor yorkie who has already suffered because of him by breaking his leg when my brother quickly let him go whilst holding him like a child holds a teddy bear by its armpits.\n\nI know this makes it look i have more things against my mom and not my brother which in a way is true, but that doesn't change the feelings i feel towards him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"comment": "Another user said ISPs didn't even exist back, then, though, so not sure what is going on with history exactly here I suppose?\n\n\nI'm not sure how your numbers apply exactly. Why does Donna tell the VC that all they need is 10 VAX 11/750's (which she says cost only $32,000 each) to expand their network and gain enough users to be really successful?\n\n\nWithin the context of my numbers, Cameron could easily afford to be paying everyone at Mutiny $60,000/year, which would be 4x average salaries of $15,000/year (as established in the show).\n\n\n\nHowever, if your number of \"monthly cost per user\" is correct at $3,000/month. Then how is Mutiny even a company at all? if a user played 8 hours a day, every single day for 30 days (a standard month), they would only play 240 hours a month, producing $1,200 in revenue per month; meaning that if they played 16 hours a day, every single day, they would only be producing $2,400/month. It's not until a user plays 20 hours a day, EVERY SINGLE DAY, for 30 days, that they even hit the break even of $3,000/month. So Mutiny is expecting to build a userbase of players who literally play their games a minimum of 21 hours a day, every single day, sleeping just 3 hours a day? Meanwhile, these insane users also have to be wildly wealthy since they are spending $3,150/month = $37,8000/year on this game and literally all they do is play the game and sleep for half of what most human beings need to remain alive every night. So essentially, Mutiny only makes money off of methed out gaming addicted millionaires... given this context, we should wonder why they are even a company at all. Why aren't they raising rates dramatically? \n\nThe ironic thing, though, is that with these extreme calculations, they should still be profitable if you're correct.\n\nAccording to your assertion, they somehow have 800 methed out millionaires whom they make $150/month off of above their massive user networking cost of $3,000/month. That would still be $120,000/month. Let's say everyone of the 17 people at Mutiny make $60,000, which is sort of insane considering that in season 1, $40,000 is considered an absurdly high salary, but if you go with the $60,000, then 17*$5,000/month = $85,000/month in salaries. That leaves $35,000 in profits per month to pay for rent and electricity, etc... So they should still be wildly successful.\n\n\nThe much more likely scenario is obviously their users probably only play, maybe 8-10 hours a day, if that, and thus they actually lose a tremendous amount of money on every user. If that is the case, though, then how does this company exist at all? How is addressing the fact that for every user they add, they LOSE several thousand dollars per month not the MAIN dramatic element in the show?", "score": 2, "subreddit": "HaltAndCatchFire"}
{"comment": "Maybe I should put some kind of alert on this subreddit.  I missed this post.  I might have been able to share a job posting with you as we just hired a new person on our ground systems team about two months ago.\n\nTruthfully, if you're a newly minted programmer, I have to honestly say that I suggest you look elsewhere.  Not that HST isn't full of great smart people, but we're talking about a 30 year old (this year!) project with a LOT of heritage systems, including some VMS running on Vax and Alpha hardware.  Do you even know what that is? Not trying to be mean.  I don't expect most people to know what those are. There's almost no reason to.  They're museum pieces, except here.   Not trying to highlight a vulnerability because it isn't.  Those systems are serving us well, but there's not much point to learning about them if you haven't already.  The rest of the ground system is a bit more modern, but not equivalent to more modern systems used elsewhere in NASA.  The last major revision was done around 2000.  It's possible working on HST still has prestige value, but as a practical matter, the experience will only be abstractly applicable to other projects as they have moved way beyond towards newer and different architectures.  HST is pretty much a one-off custom vehicle in many senses, from its hardware configuration all the way to the ground systems.\n\nIf you're still interested, there could be opportunities, rare ones, in ground system as well as flight software development but they happen very infrequently.  Most people here have been here since the 90's and intend to stay until retirement at this point.   I'm just a child with only 15 years.  Plus, we are WAY smaller now than during the Servicing Mission days.  Back then we had over 800 on the project, and now we're less than 100 and few new positions have been created in the last few years.  That could change if another servicing mission is granted, but that can't be counted on with politics being what they are.  If all that doesn't dissuade you, keep an eye on Lockheed Martin and KBR job postings in Greenbelt, MD.  LM is the prime and KBR is our largest sub.  I think we still have a couple Raytheon folks and a few tiny subs with 1-5 FTEs on the project.\n\nAt the very least, you should keep an eye on all projects at Goddard.

This is not representative of the general population, by any stretch of the imagination, where in general the number of totally unvaccinated children number in the low single digits. \n\nthis person sees it as an issue, that homeschooling people are not representative of the whole public???\n\nthat is the whole reason why homeschoolers were chosen my god what an idiot, the person who wrote this must be, or deliberately misleading.\n\nthis person also links to \"several vaxxed vs antivax studies\" through this article:\n\n [https://thoughtscapism.com/2015/04/10/myth-no-studies-compare-the-health-of-unvaccinated-and-vaccinated-people/](https://thoughtscapism.com/2015/04/10/myth-no-studies-compare-the-health-of-unvaccinated-and-vaccinated-people/) \n\nwhich is basically a joke, this article goes over the clear flaws with these studies:\n\n [http://vaccinepapers.org/alleged-vax-unvaxed-debunked/](http://vaccinepapers.org/alleged-vax-unvaxed-debunked/) \n\nfor example the first study (germany 2011 kiggs study) didn't have 18000 subjects, but only 14148.\n\nof those 14148 only 94!!! yes 94 people were the unvaccinated group, that is: 0.664%.\n\nhaving an unvaccinated group with less than 100 people, and claiming it's a huge study is an utter joke and bullshit.\n\nthe PILOT homeschool study had  261 unvaccinated children or 2.78x more than this kiggs joke of a study.\n\n261 is already a really low number, but 94 is a joke :D\n\nand i am STILL waiting for your   proper double blind, placebo controlled, randomized longterm studies comparing fully unvaccinated vs fully vaccinated children, that have proven, that vaccines don't cause autism, as u claimed, that vaccines don't, so u MUST have the clear  gold standard evidence, that proves this right?\n\nno pilot study, no 94 person in control group joke study, but a proper big scale double blind, inert-placebo controlled study.\n\nu claimed sth., yet u don't provide ANY evidence to back yourself up? i dare say:\n\n&gt; We went over this ad nauseam.  \n\nis a wrong statement, or \"we went over this\", yet u   refused to provide evidence?", "score": 5, "subreddit": "DebateVaccines"}

{"comment": "The \"Whisteblower\" is such a huge conspiracy, a conspiracy on which the Vaxxed thing was based on.\n\nDouble Blind Placebo Controlled Randomized Longterm studies comparing fully unvaccinated vs fully vaccinated children are unethical when using vaccines that have already been proven safe and effective in dozens of studies. You'd be denying children protection from dangerous diseases without their parents knowing which group they belong to. Thus you'd leave them at risk for dangerous diseases, serious consequences and death. That is plain unethical.\n\nVaccines don't cause autism. As has been shown in multiple studies. For example, a study with over 600,000 children in Denmark showed no increased risk of autism in the vaccinated group, not even an increase in those who were already \"at higher risk\" because of family history.\n\nHere's your evidence:  [https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2727726/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination-autism-nationwide-cohort-study](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2727726/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination-autism-nationwide-cohort-study)\n\n\" **Conclusion:**\n\nThe study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what \"pilot study\" this guy is talking about but 666 is a quite a small sample size.

Based on that you can formulate a certain hypothesis. In this case the hypothesis is not founded by any scientific proof (because anti vaxx is BS of course and proven to be BS). If another person states the hypothesis the other way around, like: vaccination is not causing autism, you can actually back this up by information you have found and support the reasoning of why you're doing research in that way.

That if the sick person and the elders have faith, god will intervene. This leads to a reluctance to show doubt by seeking medical treatments. There are quotes from Brigham Young showing this attitude was a problem from the earliest days of the church. And while the churches policy is typically \"get a blessing and a doctor\", this is often ignored. \n\nOn top of that is the general turning off of the BS detector that is required to accept a blessing in the first place. Once a member accepts that blessed oil has healing properties, they can accept pretty much anything. This sets up an environment where essential oils, anti vax and other similar nonsense can survive. \n\nSo it's not that the church rejects medical treatment.

Im not either, but the difference is i have seen 1st hand the damages vaccines can do-not that all are bad, some types are, and to lie and cover up the truth because its not friendly to your agenda is shitty.\n\nin addition the \"herd immunity\" logic is bullshit, it might work in the lab, or in a vacuum, but we dont live in a vacuum or a lab, there are viruses in the wild, and under the right environment they can survive indefinitely. i cant speak to every type, but for corona viruses that is the case, and i dont see why it would be any different for the others types either.\n\nthe mega rich, and the corporations they own (big pharama included), many are actively involved in eugenics, covertly. and the \"federal vaccine court\" to protect big pharma from lawsuits serves as a shield to protect them from adverse affects, even intentionally adding dangerous ingredients to vaccines, or bad and flat out fake data in clinical trials and even lying to the FDA to get them approved.\n\nthis is why there has been an explosion in vaccines types since the special court was set up in the 80s, making it literally impossible to sue the manufactures, and making the proof that vaccines harm people much higher standard than in normal courts. in addition you are literally fighting the government-who hires top attorneys whether there is any lawsuits or not, so its not big deal for them to drag suits out many years, exhausting the resources of 99.9% of people whom have been harmed-so in that way alone the system is not fair for all, generally only the rich, very rich can afford to pay attorneys to fight cases that may last many many years, despite that as of 2017 the court has paid out over $3,700,000,000.00usd in the previoius 10yrs to people that the government agrees have been injured/mainmed/handicapped/killed/ from vaccines-in the US alone.\n\nI suggest you look into Eugenics, its history, ways its currently being practiced-although in the past the word has been avoided because of its evil nature.\n\n\"Fittingly enough, eugenics actually has some of its roots with Charles Darwin.

Here's an interesting fact though that can probably help you--if the dog was never purchased/adopted under her name, nor ever taken to a vet there's virtually no record of her owning the dog. The dog is legally homeless. You can check with someone at animal control for the certain legal status but I'm quite certain that if you take the dog to the vet or register it under YOUR name, you then have legal control and there's record of it being your dog.\n\nWhat you can do if this is the case (that I very strongly suggest) is to take the dog to a free/cheap pet clinic (Petco does vax ones), and you can prob get her basic rabies, DHPP and bordatella for $15-35. Rabies and DHPP are the only REAL important ones now though. See if you can rent a bath at a pet store to give her a flea-bath (usually $10).  These affordable procedures would not only help you gain legal control over the dog but protect her and your family from disease. Ultimately though, unless you want to TRULY take ownership of the dog (which it doesn't sound like you do), you need to surrender her to a rescue. If you want to it's fine to leave the dog un-spayed, they will take care of if and that is a significant cost you shouldn't have to incur. If you tell me what type of dog it is and your location, I can give you the name of rescues that may be able to take her in. Please include the dog's age as well. \n\nTell your sister after you've gained papers more or less giving you ownership of the dog that she has not taken proper care of the dog and you are sorry but her health and well-being has not only been neglected but put the human and bird members of your household at risk so it is best to find her another home. Your sister is not much more than a kid--and emotionally sounds like a freaking 14 year old, so she has to learn to deal with this. Even if she does storm out and leave, chances are she will end up coming back because it doesn't sound like she's got many options. \n\nLet me know how it goes!", "score": 2, "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

{"comment": "Some C1 and C2 spoilers ahead:\n\nIn C1, I wasn't too much of a fan of Vex. She wasn't the worst, but grog, scanlan and percy were my favorite by leagues. I thought Laura just wasn't as inspired, she definitely didn't have as many memorable moments. \n\nWhen she started playing Jester, she BLEW me away. Jester felt so much more developed, and so fun to watch. She seems to be the most three dimensional character at the table. I just really hope her recent dice luck gets better.\n\nAll of the cast's characters feel stronger (well, except nott and scanlan, they're pretty equal in my opinion, maybe later C1 scanlan was better imo). \n\nCadeuceus seems to be against type for Talesin compared with Molly and Percy, but he feels like such a strong character, I love Cad. Holy weapon on Beau is killer and he's pulled off some clutch saves with crit cancels, vulnerabilities, bless, and bane.\n\nGrog was awesome, but his low intelligence (although funny) limited Travis. Fjord is on a really cool character arc. I LOVE the theming of a warlock paladin multiclass, and not just due to the synergy, but it makes for an epic story.\n\nKeyleth was okay, but Beau is awesome (I'm not an anti-marisha type, but I have little doubt that the options druids have overwhelmed Marisha sometimes, such as the purple worm wind walk fiasco), she's roleplayed very well, her combat descriptions are awesome and very much what I love about monks.\n\nI loved Scanlan, and even though Nott is an amazing character with a tragic backstory, is memorable, funny, and powerful, Scanlan is the best character of Critical Role in my opinion. Nothing tops his late C1 arc, and the finale. Sam is a peak spellcaster, and his inspiration was great.\n\nYasha is very memorable. I could tell they put a lot of effort into making sure she was interesting, since Ashley's involvement was relatively low because of her acting career. I liked Pike, she was 1 dimensional in my opinion, but that wasn't because of Ashley's ability, but her frequency at the table. I wish she was there more in C1, but now that she's going to be there near full time, I'm excited to see what she has planned.\n\nAnd Caleb... I love Caleb. I see a trend in Liam's characters, both Caleb and Vax are somber, flaw ridden characters. Caleb's backstory is very impactful and intense, and I can't help but love full casters.

But it certainly wasn\u2019t the only aspect and it wasn\u2019t a bad thing either. Vox machine included some very heavy characters, Vax, Percy and Keyleth, the comedy that Vex, Scanlan and grog brought was a necessary palette cleanser, vex definitely contributed to that with her greedy snarky antics. \nBut behind all that was a capacity to love and forgive. \n\nVex was the one that most obviously felt guilt and grief over Scanlans leaving, most easily able to see how Vox Machina has failed Scanlan. She was also one of the first to accept Tary and bonded with him the quickest. She was also the quickest to forgive Scanlan. \nI also noticed that each character had tight connections to certain others within the group. \n\nScanlan felt most connected with pike and grog. \nPercy to Keyleth and Vex\nVax to vex and Keyleth \nGrog to Scanlan and Pike \nPike to Scanlan and Grog \nKeyleth to Percy and Vax \nBut Vex felt like she was connected to almost everyone, more so than the others I felt.

It's true though that Vax never found the answer that he wanted. He once did the thing with Scanlan about how he could be so upbeat all the time, but wasn't satisfied with the answer. I guess Vax struggled to find purpose in life? None of the other characters ever really confronted him about it, which was part of the problem I think, 'cause he sure as hell wasn't gonna get Vax out of that insanely deep depression hole himself.", "score": 5, "subreddit": "criticalrole"}

{"comment": "I agree he does play that very well indeed for me it went like this. \n\nSam\u2019s characters: Scanlan was easily the best character in the first campaign, the most layered and the most enjoyable and mechanically it felt as though he got it right first time and just fell onto his perfect roll as a save or suck/control caster. Nott I would say is probably my second fave character in the nine, she\u2019s fleshed out and she has layers, but I think sometimes you can see that Sam is frustrated with his lack of options mechanically. I can\u2019t wait to see what none illusion none enchantment spells he picks, that said, Nott has been responsible for one of my fave 2 scenes in campaign to, the re-union with her family. Even Tarion although he initially was a meme, quickly turned into an amazing, fleshed out character and again brought necessary levity to the game. \n\nI think Sam just seems to have a massive knack for creating lovable characters and more than anything, read tone and know when to inject levity into the game. \n\nLaura\u2019s characters: I immediately loved Vex, I\u2019ve played a similar character in the past, desperate to climb socially, blinded by disadvantage. She ended up marrying a character in our campaign too. The closest facsimile in critical role would be grog, he was a war priest of Sarenrea. As the campaigned got darker Vex became a breath of fresh for me because alongside Scanlan and grog she was one of the lighter characters and she loved her friends unconditionally which was great. She was probably top 3 or second for me in Campaign 1. Jester feels like Laura getting to show off what she could come up with once she understood how the game worked and it just shows how brilliant she is. Layered, beautifully and honestly I think he tragedy works much better than the likes of Percy or Caleb even though it isn\u2019t the focus of her character. Best character of campaign 2 for me. \n\nTravis\u2019s characters: The third character that really sung for me was Grog in campaign one. Travis was held back by the low intelligence in some way but in others it allowed his acting to sing. He was able to show the humility and child like innocence of the giant man who knows he\u2019s slower than his friends and sometimes lets it get to him, beautifully. Conversely where as when Travis made grogs low intelligence work for him, I find Travis seems to struggle to represent Fjords high charisma score. He seems reluctant to lead role play situations as a charisma character and I sometimes find myself frustrated at his unwillingness to use his voice in these situations, where-in he\u2019d often be the best suited to take the lead.  \n\nAshleigh\u2019s characters: Pike I loved but we never got enough of her for Ashleigh to do what other players did with her characters, although I\u2019m sure she was capable of it. The same goes for Yasha, but he scene in the fight pit was incredible. I can\u2019t wait to see what Ashleigh does now. Hopefully remembering to rage. \n\nMarisha\u2019s characters: I was never a detractor of Marisha, but I really did understand the dislike of Keyleth, a lot of the time it felt like Marisha didn\u2019t know how to run her and so a lot of her actions didn\u2019t make sense. Roll play wise it just felt like she was a beat behind or just different from from the rest of the gang. That said her low charisma blunders were fun. Beau on the other hand feels perfect, she seems more well suited to the nine than Keyleth was to vox machina and Marisha clearly knows what\u2019s she\u2019s doing better. I just wish she\u2019d remember she could run vertically up walls. Lol. \n\nLiam\u2019s characters: Vax started off shallow but that\u2019s fine lots of characters did, but his development was just a plunge into grief that felt more to do with Liam than the character. I found him exhausting by the end. Caleb at least feels as though his grief is written in his backstory rather than forced and therefore makes sense. But Liam seems unwilling to let Caleb heal or develop which is again, exhausting. \n\nTaliesin characters: Percy was my least fave character in campaign one. His self loathing was written in and paid lip service too, but it never felt really. He felt to arrogant and I think Talisen loved and enjoyed the character too much to ever properly portray self loathing too. Like Liam does with Caleb. Molly felt like the other side of the same coin, he wasn\u2019t as dark and edgy, but he was still the projecting the image of someone who knew better than everyone else in the room. In this case however he seemed to be able to let other people in on the joke that he didn\u2019t really know everything he was just guessing and in this way was more charming. Mechanically however he seemed like a flop. Cad feels like a departure from this type of character. Embracing the unknown, it\u2019s joyous. I can\u2019t wait to see his family.", "score": 4, "subreddit": "criticalrole"}

My family is very healthy because we go out of our way to reduce toxins and eat as super clean as possible, most of the time. But all around me, everybody is sick.

Many people find any amount of vegan ideas to be taboo or distasteful. If these same people were to have it normalized that \"this vegan can be good and agreeable to me because they still feed their kid vegan\" then you can see how this can be a bridge between the two ideas (veganism is an awful idea vs veganism is alright in this scenario, leading to the idea that veganism is alright and agreeable even if the kid is fed vegan food, and eventually, veganism is not just agreeable, it's actually better, eventually leading to \"I should be vegan.\").\n\n&gt;Re your comments about anti-vax: the equivalent would be people criticising it, not trying to cast doubt on the soundness of vaccinations.\n\nWho was criticising or casting doubt on anything? Readers of that comment who may have at one point been completely against vegans were introduced to the idea of a \"softer\" vegan that is closer to their own ideals, thus making people more agreeable to this type of vegan. From there, after this type of behavior is normalized, readers of future vegan scenarios may find more \"extreme\" (extreme in their eyes) vegan ideas more palatable. This is the process of normalizing taboo ideas. Society as a whole can't shift their views overnight, you're working against culture here.

Not gay marriage though. This is agreeable to me.\" and \"I don't want them getting married but they can be considered a family. This is agreeable to me.\" Then society gets used to these ideas through these and other \"stepping stones\" even though it's not really at the end goal yet.

{"comment": "Good on ya. You are very correct.\n\nVaccinations do not grant super powers or force fields.\nEverybody still contracts diseases and uses their own immune system to fend off said diseases. There is no difference between vaxxed and unvaxxed persons. \n\nA vaccination is an attempt at \u201cboosting\u201d immunity to levels high enough that the CONTRACTED disease can\u2019t take a foothold and reach levels that pose a threat to health or transmission. \n\nThe \u201cboost\u201d is inconsistent between people, varing in effectiveness and speed of boost decay. This can remove the \u201cboost\u201d attempted by vaxxes very quickly. \n\nSo the person scalding the disgusting unvaxxed heathen could very well be the one spreading diseases. A healthy unvaxxed could easily be \u201cpreventing\u201d the spread of disease just as much as a vaxxed person.\n\n\n\nI think you are sensing the real plague that is on the horizon. A plague of the mind, that eats at the fundamental core principal of the greatest society ever to exist on the planet. That core principal is the freedom of the individual.\n\nThe government still taxes the unvaxxed and vaxxed in equal proportions, but seeks to remove services from one of those \u201csegregation\u2019s\u201d.

Also 50% of mercury in breast milk is organic mercury attached to organic compounds making it easier for processing. I personally would still choose to risk autism over terminal diseases.

What do you mean when you say \"the State being allowed to review a citizen's statement about their religion and the State making determinations therein\"? The statement about one's religion would be \"I am X religion and my religion does not allow vaccination\"? And the state determination would be \"ok, no school for you\"? If it's more complicated than that, I'm not sure. \n\n2. \"I believe they should leave it up to the municipalities (no vax? No public school) and leave Religion out of it.\" Whether state or municipality rules it, the end result is no vax = no school, right? So why prefer municipal rule? Should some towns continue to allow unvaccinated kids to school if they so choose? I'm just unclear on what difference the distinction makes. Ahhhh, wait I get it, because the new rule is specifically about religious exemptions. \n\n3. What new right exactly is being granted and how would it matter be applied to non-vax issues? \n\nSometimes I write too much and people think I'm being aggressive or something but I'm open to changing my mind and I think you can give me some insight into the other side of this debate.

Instead of writing my name on a VAXXED van to mourn my very existence, they showed me off and called me their \u201clittle professor.\u201d I had horrible self esteem but eventually grew to love who I am. \n\nThen I read comments like this mom\u2019s and am quixotically shocked how she seems unfazed by her gaslighting tactics casting doubt on the mental sanity of her \u201cinjured\u201d son. I couldn\u2019t imagine where I\u2019d be today if I was raised like this and thought of myself as damaged instead of different. If my parents thought my neurodiversity was a result of vaccines (something that obviously isn\u2019t the case), not only would they likely have still vaccinated me, but they certainly wouldn\u2019t have been phased by my autonomous decision to catch up on my missing vaccines later down the road. In other words, expressing anger over her child\u2019s autonomy only serves as further proof that this is organized religion combined with shitty parenting rather than a desire to protect one\u2019s  personal freedoms or \u201csafety\u201d as they vehemently claim.

{"comment": "&gt; To me that is exactly what the pro life  government is doing to woman. Abortion is the person faced with harm and trying to pull the trigger which is their only option to avoid it. \n\nMajority of abortions are elective, meaning these women abort for reasons that are not pertaining to their health. And again pro life governments allow them in life threatening situations. What harm could you have for not being allowed to abort, if your only reason for the abortion is \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a mother\u201d?\n\n\n&gt; The pro life government is sliding their stick behind the trigger telling them \"the harms not serious enough yet\"  \"your life isn't at risk yet\" forcing them right up to the point where the harm and risk is imminent then removing the stick and not be held accountable when we come to find it was in there too long. \n\nThat\u2019s not how it works, most life threatening pregnancies show symptoms or appear around when the baby is viable. At that point you can just take it out rather then killing it. If it\u2019s an ectopic pregnancy the doctor can detect it and threat the patient. The only way someone would wait until the point the pregnancy would kill them, is if they are intentionally doing it so that self defense may apply so that they can kill their child.\n\n&gt; I feel the legislators and hospitals should be held accountable for these cases if they enforce these laws.\n\nSure but those cases would be rare. It\u2019s unreasonable to believe a doctor would just let you die.\n\n&gt; No it's telling a human being it will allow them this service when they deem it appropriate\n\nSame thing that I said.\n\n&gt; and not be held accountable when they're wrong. \n\nAgain you would have to prove this will happen, the law would only legislate that life threatening situations would be an exemption. Forget self defense, that\u2019s what\u2019s screwing your thinking. Who decides if your life is in danger? The doctors, if they mess up that\u2019s on them because they were wrong not the law makers. \n\n&gt; It's hijacking a person's healthcare with impunity.\n\nI\u2019d be hard pressed to call an elective abortion *healthcare*\n\n&gt; If its justified to abort to save the life of the mother the mother is justified to abort earlier to avoid that situation altogether\n\nYeah but this only applies to  an ectopic pregnancy. All other life threatening conditions you can just deliver the child and the mother will be fine because again they only appear around the time the baby is viable. Do all babies make it? Nope, do all mothers make it? Definitely.\n\n&gt; and it is not the government place to hold a person hostage and determine for them when they get the best treatment. \n\nThe government has already, can and will infringe on bodily autonomy when it determines that it\u2019s necessary to protect the well being of society. That\u2019s why drugs, and prostitution are illegal and forced blood test are legal.\n\n&gt; I almost want to say for this to be ethical to me all abortions legal or all illegal even if to save the mother.\n\nIs it ethical to kill someone just for an inconvenience?\n\n&gt; Thats not how it works. \n\nYes it does\n\n&gt; It does not stop one from defending themselves. \n\nNo, the law can physically stop anyone, however it defines what self defense is, and if you don\u2019t follow it, you go to jail. \n\n\n&gt; Everyone who is not pregnant gets to defend themselves and then be judged and seeing how pregnancy is serious, certain, and inescapable harm, all woman are justified to abort.\n\nThat\u2019s not how self defense works, you should look it up before claiming it does.\n\nThe threat must be immediate, the aggressor must be reasonably perceived of being capable of producing the threat, and to be able to use deadly force the same amount of force must be used against you. So again just because you are harmed does not mean you can abort.\n\n&gt; Absurd. That is nothing like pregnancy.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter, this is on the subject of self defense \n\n&gt; First, are you currently and directly harmed by this un vaxxed person? No. __You stand a small chance of catching that you could easily mediate by covering your mouth and if you caught anything you can go to the doctors for Medican.__\n\nJust like you stand a small chance from dying from a child birth?\n\n&gt;After you recover your body goes back to being exactly the same. Second, in order for the self defense justification to work the person has to reasonably believe that the other is a serious and direct threat and that the person defending thenselves reasonably believed their action was the only action they could take to avoid injury. No judge is going to believe someone actually believed shooting someone killed the germs already there.\n\nExactly, you just prove my point. Did you or me get to decide? No the judge did. \n\nSo saying this\n\n&gt;You\u2019re taking it upon yourself to decide what level of harm or risk I\u2019M are facing before ALLOWING myself a defense that would have saved myself from whatever harm I\u2019m are facing now. \n\nWouldn\u2019t matter because ultimately it\u2019s their job to decide. They decide based on the law, so ultimately the law decides, no one else. The same applies with a pregnancy. You don\u2019t get to determine how much danger you were in, the judge does.\n\n&gt; I argue that pregnancy is in fact harmful to woman and it's certainty along with its inescapability satisfies all requirements for self defense. Naturality, your romantasism of pregnancy, your preconceived notions of concent don't factor in. She's a human being and she has a right to protect herself from harm whether inflicted by a guilty or innocent party, pregnancy is harm and inescapable.\n\nYou would argue that case and lose. If you even got self defense to apply, you have to wait until the point where the deadly force is being used. Just because your pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you get an exception.\n\n&gt; No it's not serious harm nor __inescapable.__ \n\nGive birth\n\n&gt; Ridiculous pro life analogies that outright dismiss or construe the harm pregnant woman face. It's deceiving.\n\nAnd you guys make it it seem it\u2019s the worst thing in the world, I been around plenty of pregnant women and I show them these arguments. They all say the same thing, none of it justifies the killing of a child. So I don\u2019t know who\u2019s trying to deceive who here.", "score": 0, "subreddit": "Abortiondebate"}

{"comment": "I played Empire on a VAX system as a university student in Montreal from 1990-1994. You would put in your moves and it would process them sort of turn based as you put them in, then you were out of movement/effort which would refresh at the \"Update\". Either 15mins-1hr for Blitz games but typically once per day.  It was a great multiplayer experience with diplomacy, chat, backstabbing etc., and a logarithm based tech tree that made you optimize production vs research.  Georgia Tech ran some servers.  We always wanted to see the daily leaderboard refresh for a game (usually 10-20 players).\n\nGreat times and it was the inspiration for Empire Wargame of the Century by Walter Bright.  It still survives in a newer form by Killer Bee software on Steam. Truly fantastic 4x stuff when you keep fog of war on and have to discover the map.  The original interface was text and not intuitive.  You compiled the empire client from source that you ftped anonymously (but email uid/pwd) from White Sands Missile Base. (The US army had the biggest software repo).\n\nWe called it the \"Net\" back then and it was pretty much for university students (engineering/compsci/hardcore hobbyist nerds) only.  There was no web, and no commercial content allowed (under acceptable use policies).\n\nThe \"net\" at school was email with pine, Usenet with vnews, anonymous ftp with Archie, Veronica and Jughead, WAIS, finger and telnet.  Gopher was better than www and when I telnetted into the first webserver at CERN in Nov. '91 I didn't think my buddies at Libretel, the Montreal Freenet project (to bring the Internet to the \"great unwashed\" masses before AOL's \"coaster\" CDs) had it right as Gopher had better UI/UX.  I once got a bill for $24CDN for ftping a 1MB file from McGill's MUSICA mainframe.  I was a Concordia student, so I didn't pay.  I also got a call from a Concordia Sysadmin, asking me why I would ever download a 800k file to my home computer (using kermit protocol at 98cps tying up their modem pool).  Well \"it was FSUUCP so I could provide email and usenet to my friends taking the load off the university, thank you so much sir\". Lol.\n\nI knew the Web had really taken off in 1994 when the CompEng. students used their time on the SPARC Stations to surf porn in the lab instead of doing VLSI problem sets.

{"comment": "Fine, I'll be cordial. But I don't respect people making value judgments on things they state they outright and clearly don't understand.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but a communications degree doesn't mean you'll have a good grasp of social psychology and specific theories. I'm not going to pretend to understand your field and comment on what the findings or practices within it are, and you would balk at my doing so. So why would you pretend to understand another's whose basic elements you are totally unaware of? Do you see how arrogant it is to assume you can speak for it when you are by definition ignorant of it? I'm ignorant of communications and what it entails, it's not a fault, but it is if I started making value judgments about it based on that ignorance. \n\n&gt;1.) its not a straw man. You said the term denoted gender-specific behavior. What behavior is exclusively masculine that deserves to be studied separately from female behaviors of similar quality?\n\nIt doesn't need to be exclusive. That's the strawman. It's identifying a trend, and trends are by nature not exclusive. \"Masculine ideals\" are something we can categorize, many of them are seen as quite positive traits and are a part of gender normative concepts. We also identify \"feminine ideals\" in similar ways. \"Toxic masculinity\" is identifying a subset of \"masculine ideals\" that are in many ways harmful. \n\nSo for you to say it needs to be separated from the gender is to show a fundamental misunderstanding of the term and its use. To call it badly constructed based on that misunderstanding is not a difference of opinion, it's just a fault. You don't have to come around and agree with me on that, but I'm not going to accept that as just a difference of opinion as that implies both have similar validity. \n\nSaying it's frequently misused? Sure, but so is so many terms - hell, \"racism\" is an extremely frequent one where there is great divide between lay person's understanding of it and how academics discuss it and use the term. I don't know if it's misuse or just different use, I'm not a linguist, but that's not going to drop its value as a term in academia anytime soon. That is a difference of opinion.\n\nAnd for what it counts, thanks for hearing me out and I apologise for my terseness and unnecessary rudeness. There's a lot of scientific subjects that have wide misunderstanding around them, but social science matters are consistently misunderstood and disrespected by prominent figures and people very often think they understand them better or to a similar degree as experts. At least when a doctor mocks anti-vaccine people and their beliefs, generally people respect their expertise. Reddit loves that shit for instance, vax happened or w.e is a popular subreddit. But support for the science doesn't extend to all sciences, and that means those groups have to fight just to be taken at their word. \n\nIf an engineer tells you you're wrong about how the math works out, people tend to take them at their word. If a political scientist says \"that isn't why he lost the election\" then he'll probably be informed why he is wrong instead. \n\nIt's kind of a source of constant frustration. At least on Reddit.

{"comment": "*Long reply, mobile formatting, apologies*\n\nI'll just interject here to say that I share your struggles with Beau every once in a while. Marisha has a specific way of playing her characters that pushes several of my buttons, which probably isn't a problem with her mostly me, for example in high tension situations she'll say something that seems kind of dumb or she'll lecture people who might not take it very well. \n\nThe reason this gets on my nerves is that I am extremely invested in their well being and I can't handle it when they aren't handling the situation as well as they could be. Often I'll turn the stream off for a moment to give myself a breather when either Beau or anyone does something that seems like a really bad idea, they forget something obvious, etc. I'm not ignorant to my internal biases so I try to minimize my reactions to their behavior as I can, because most of the time this show is an absolute pleasure.\n\nIf you share a similar problem with Beau, then you'll probably feel equally or more annoyed with Keyleth, sadly. The shtick of her character is that she's growing up into a responsibility with zero social skills. Marisha has admitted as much saying that she actively sought out ways to roleplay someone who doesn't know how to socialize by putting her foot in her mouth. She did get shit for it, but still stuck to her guns with how she roleplayed it so respect to her. \n\nWatching through the first campaign when Keyleth was the center of attention brought me to the point of loathing that character, but it didn't ruin it for me. After finishing the campaign and having more insight on how Marisha roleplayed her have softened my viewpoint, but I won't know for sure how I feel completely until I revisit it. Among the character stuff that irritated me, she was learning druid and had a bumpy ride learning the avalanche of spells that class has so I don't fault her for that stuff nearly as much.\n\nOf course Marisha isn't the only one who plays on my nerves in that way, Vex from C1 would also annoy me especially towards the beginning and Vax would occasionally morally grandstand in a way that wasn't far off from Beau(and some of Jester's antics have given me anxiety attacks). Either way I try to process everything and contextualize it to push myself through the moment.\n\nSorry about it getting rambly, but I just wanted to let you know that you aren't alone and that your concerns are legitimate. And don't be scared to watch campaign 1 because I didn't enjoy Keyleth, there are a lot of highs to eclipse the lows.\n\nTL:DR: Marisha has a certain way of playing her characters in high tension moments that rubs me the wrong way (although I admit that it's probably a me problem). Keyleth is more of the negative side of that roleplay and then some. Regardless she isn't the only one that annoys me in a similar way and in the end it doesn't really matter most of the time.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "criticalrole"}

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n Just created this account for this purpose. Here's the situation:\n\nMy daughter is 8. I'm a full time working mom, my sister is a stay at home mom who home schools. I was raised home schooled and still resent it. My sister is part of a home schoolers group and when she threw my nephews' birthday party some of nephews' friends were there. My daughter went and instantly clicked with a 9 year old girl. They have been joined at the hip for MONTHS and will face time for hours, they are best friends.\n\nFast forward to the other day when I'm having a discussion with my sister. I can't remember how it came up, but I said the one thing I can't tolerate is Anti-Vaxxers. They terrify me. Anyone who would disregard science at the risk of small children scare the shit out of me. Obviously if someone can't get a vax for medical reasons I get it, but people who feed into lies and try to cure the flu with essential oils (i love oils i think they smell really good) are not my kind of people. Her face kind of went blank and she said, 'Well (my daughter's best friend)'s family doesn't vaccinate.'\n\nBomb dropped. I said quietly that I'm afraid I won't let my children be around them any more. Then she went on to say how a good portion of her home school group is anti-vax. It blindsided me and I was shocked that my sister didn't seem concerned about it.\n\nI haven't made any decisions or told my daughter, but this situation has me shook. I NEVER in my life wanted to raise my daughter in or around any of the type of people that I was forced to be around as a child.  I don't want her around people who don't research facts or learn science, anti vaxxers are the main group of people on this earth that I flat out think are crazy. If you're an anti vaxxer and reading this it's nothing personal, I just can not understand you whatsoever and I would never knowingly let you in my life. First of all vaccines don't cause autism, second of all if in some world they did I do think autism is better than dying of a preventable horrible disease. As far as the 'you're poisoning your body' bull shit, that doesn't work on me because I don't live on a prairie. It's 2020, harmful substances are everywhere, vaccines are the least of those. I'm already certain I won't go to my sister's house when members of her home school group are there, and I won't drop my kids off with her if she's going to her home school group that day. \n\nSo people of Reddit - WIBTA for banning my child from seeing her best friend because they're anti-vaxx?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"comment": "I used to agree with this, but I don't anymore, having seen the destruction being wreaked across humanity by disinformation. There is just no benefit to allowing people to spread complete lies. Often lies can be simple and wonderful and be made easy to understand, so people are more likely to latch onto them than they will the complex truth, which often needs patience, concentration and education to understand. If everyone was very well educated from childhood at how to spot lies and bullshit and how to evaluate evidence, what constitutes as evidence etc, then maybe it would be different, but as it is, we've got people believing seriously damaging things, and allowing disinformation only makes it all the more easy for the powers that be to completely manipulate and control people. If you have a standard of evidence that is required for putting out information, or some kind of check on it, then at least people will have a better chance of knowing what is actually real. The truth is important, more important than the freedom to lie about any old bullshit in order to manipulate people.\n\nThat's not to say that people should be locked up or killed for spreading disinformation, obviously, but disinformation should be removed as much as possible and platforms and companies that allow its spread should be made legally responsible for keeping disinformation out of their products and services. It is literally going to destroy civilisation if it continues like it has been, what with all the anti vaxxers, flat earthers, climate change deniers, mass political lies and targeted propaganda that just get pumped out with no checks or barriers.

I conduct research at a university and constantly have to critically examine research, so I believe in a healthy dose of skepticism. But I'm also going to trust the experts in the field I'm unfamiliar with to a certain degree, especially over amateur attempts to poke holes. Especially since in this argument the burden of proof should lie on those saying its advantageous to cut off part of a dogs ear, rather than the vets saying hey maybe dont do that. For example if my doctor suggests something,  I see there is a general medical consensus on it, and none to negligible risk involved compared to the alternative, I may ask for a paper, but I wont quibble over the intricacies of the specific sources of said paper and waste the doctors time in a vain attempt to appear intelligent through unending criticism. That is the equivalent of anti vax moms looking for the tiniest of holes in pro-vax litersture. \n\nAnd frankly none of your criticisms are that damning.\n\n&gt;14 of the 19 references are not accurate or intentionally misleading.\n\nYou provide no evidence to that claim.\n\nAll of your criticisms boil down to them \"padding\" irrelevant references or citing things that go against their conclusion. However those seemingly irrelevant references are extremely important. In ANY proffessional paper, you reference everything. If you got an idea from one sentence of an opinion piece, or youre saying AKCs opinion on cropping, you cite it. That's research 101. Not doing so is plagiarism.\n\nNot to mention so called \"opinion pieces\" from vets who have experience dealing with injuries related to ear cropping is perfectly valid supplemental evidence in the discussion of the efficacy of ear cropping. Especially if there isnt a lot of direct research on cropping. \n\n As to their citation that supports ear cropping, of course they include it. What kind of a meta analysis or lit review would it be if they didn't review both sides?\n\nIn the end you provide no valid criticisms against their central point that there is not enough evidence supporting the benefits of cropping to outweigh the inherent risks.", "score": 2, "subreddit": "awfuleverything"}

Plus, he was mad at TLC because of how they portrayed him, but he\u2019s an old man marrying a girl half his age, no matter what he\u2019s going to look sleazy\n\nAngela- where to begin?

Feels the need to protect Jesse from bullies because Avery and Tim don\u2019t want to shake his hand but its okay to shove a cake in Michael\u2019s face when he sat next to girl on a boat.

I start to learn about Unix and programming and building my own machines. i decide to change my major to Comp sci except the college will not let me due to rules in the student handbook at that time. the closest i can come to comp sci is MIS(management information systems) basically computer science lite with accounting and business.\n\nso during the day i'm accountant pencil neck and at night Kevin mitnick getting into all kinds of trouble. I was taught on VAX and Unix. During all this i'm taught the ins and outs of the systems and to look for security breaches in the system or possible ways for a cracker/hacker to get into the system. In the process i actually caught a hacker that was kicked out of the Group 2 years earlier for breaking into systems and causing damage. the cracker/hacker had it in for the current leader of the group whom ran a server for the group off a Sun Sparc V7 machine. he had done what was later called a buffer Overflow hack. basically he got in to the system on a brute force attack to one lower user then written a program that used a very long string which overflowed the memory because of a lack of string length checks in the system compiler and it caused a superuser Bash command line to open from there he got into the system emails and dumped everything to the Tmp Drive.\n\ni came along because i messed around on the TMP drive sometimes you would find something kewl and i noticed a rapidly growing Dump file so i took a look inside and Cat'ted out that these where the system admins personal emails.\n\nWell i alerted my buddies in the computer club immediately this resulted in the guy getting busted and i got my 10 minutes of fame.\n\nwas then i realized i really wanted to be a computer science major. well due to problems at the university i decided to leave and try my luck back home at another university close to my parents house.\n\nso i say goodbye and start my life again at the new school. Few years are now rolling by and i'm taking my senior level courses in advanced computer languages.  \n\nI score a real asshole of a professor, barely speaks english, very hard to comprehend and is the only professor teaching this class i need to graduate. now i'm not alone this was a 4 credit plus 1 credit lab course and since the professor was the only person teaching it they had to mix the Graduate level with undergraduate students in the same class it was a nightmare because the professor would constantly try to split the course in half for the 2 levels and then forget where the line was suppose to be drawn. i was struggling with everyone else.\n\nthe last project of the class was to create a pascal compiler on a openVMS system using the professors non-working commented peudo code as a base. The system only had a Basic compiler on it by design. so you had to use basic to understand higher level Pascal text code that would go through an emulator/interpreter convert to basic and then the basic compiler would generate the machine code.\n\nthere was 4 parts to this project. i managed to get through the first 2 but there was recursion in pascal you had to deal with and there was the last part with bit shifting registers that was basically impossible from my understanding.\n\ni had worked on this for days and just could not figure out part 3.\n\nso its Tuesday 3am i'm burnt out and going insane and i decide to start farting around the openVMS system just like the old days back with the computer club. i start hitting the system all over and i notice just about nobody on the system had correct permissions setup on their accounts. since the accounts all have public access i just go right in and snoop around.\n\nAt some point in snooping i find a folder with my CS class number on it and go inside. the folder was 3 years old and belonged to a graduate student that had taken this CS course and then i assume graduated but the account was never purged. so emacs i go into the code he left. at first i really thought this account belonged to the professor but it was through discovery it was an old grad student. well sure enough same professor had the same final project in 4 parts for that year.\n\nso the grad student is also leaving nasty comments about the professor in his un-compiled code. in seeing how he solved the first 2 parts of the project i realized i made a mistake and i went back and fixed my code to make it better.\n\nthen i see how he solved problem 3 for the recursion but it was flawed. he wrote himself in the comments that he was stuck and going insane as well. well i took his code and it made me think about the problem in a different way and i was able to correct his code to work. in the process that unlocked how to solve the bit shifting issue on problem 4 and then the entire project made sense to me. the student had never made it past problem 3. \n\nfor the project we just needed to hand in compiled code for the professor to run then we were given a grade. he had a test text file that your code parsed and compiled and it automatically spit out your grade as output based on how the professors code ran.\n\ni hand it in Friday my brain was basically bubbling with adrenaline and melting over the weekend from that coding session.\n\nNext class was monday. i walk in really tired and feeling like a failure in life.\n\nteacher comes in PISSED AND yelling at the class. long story short. only one person managed to complete the project.\n\nthat person was me. in all his yelling and confusion that was when more truth spilled out. apparently the class was only suppose to do problems 1 and 2 for undergrad and grad students were suppose to complete 3 and 4.\n\nmaybe half the class had gotten problems 1 and 2 completed and the rest got nothing.\n\nCrap i was sweating balls the entire time figuring i was busted for what i did.\n\nthen he lays into the grad students that a undergrad had bested them and how screwed they were in getting a P.H.D.\n\nwell i was a nervous wreck after that and now i had daggers getting shown at me. i never told anybody in the class what happened that i got a little leg up on them i finished the class with a 'B' up from a C/D graduated then went off into the ether of the computer world where i grew to despise computers and 72 hour coding sessions and got fed up and left computers back in the late 1990s. though i programmed some cool stuff i never felt i was very good at it and never really had any idea of my own to go out and explorer. greener pastures.\n\nso that was how i found a hack to change my GPA.", "score": 10, "subreddit": "4chan"}

Which is why we weren't vaccinated against it.\n\nIs it a newer vaccine? We're the risks not thought to be that serious when I was kid (I'm 24, so not that long ago)?

The threat of complications from disease are a lot worse than those from vaccinations, but vaccines are not 100% safe. I learned this this grad school when I was forced to do a research paper for a debate against vaccinations. I don't have access to the system I had in grad school, but a quick  google scholar search pulled a few articles quickly. Again, I believe the benefits outweigh the risks, but vaccines are not risk free. Stay informed.\n\nSide note- one of these studies below hits close to home because I developed severe Narcolepsy a couple months after getting my H1N1 vaccine. I learned many years later that there was a relationship between the vaccine and the development of narcolepsy. I contacted an attorney, but the statue of limitations to sue a vaccine company is 3 years. They said I had a really strong case, but it was too late.\n\nHere are a few studies off google scholar including the oke about Narcolepsy. These studies show there is a small risk from vaccinations.

{"comment": "&gt;Ok so that paragraph was a mess but I think I understand what you meant. Workers who do harder work can get payed more as they need more money to compensate for the higher stress they are put under. No communist or socialist society that has existed has abided by the \"everyone gets the same pay no matter what\" straw-man. Stop being lazy and argue against real positions (and try to do so in a more coherent manner next time).\n\nOh ok, you want to use actual communist countries as an example to defend Communism? Lololol. Which murderous regime do you pick as an example for our discussion? I can whoop your ass on fairy tale Communism (in which, as I said, there is no money or property) or real world Communism (in which the country runs a capitalist/feudal economy for the benefit of those connected to the party). Which would you like to discuss?\n\n&gt;Of course people are lazy, the system of accountability we have now is garbage. Concentrating the power to discipline and fire employees in a small groups means that the power isn't used efficiently. If I'm working in a democratic worker co-op (a socialist model workplace) and one person is constantly slacking off then its going to be obvious to everyone who works with that person. If I have to convince a manager to do something about it its a toss-up. They probably haven't seen it because they aren't \"on the floor\" all the time and they have a bunch of other things to worry about. But if its a democratic workplace the people who see the problem first hand have the ability to vote the slacker out. No need to interface with the manager middleman. Giving people more control over their work gives them the ability to make their workplace better and thats a great thing.\n\nWhat in the flying fuck are you talking about? No communist country has ever operated on any level like this. In a communist country, the factory is run by an unaccountable friend of someone in the party. You're not accountable to your coworkers Jesus fucking Christ. You're accountable to an oligarch who is in the good graces of the partu. I find it hilarious that you want to move to the least accountable form of governance ever known to *increase* accountablility. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n\n&gt;Modern behavioral science doesn't reflect true human nature for this reason.\n\nAh yes the old \"science just doesn't understand my viewpoint argument\". Really popular with the flat Earth anti vax crowd.\n\n&gt;So because I don't let a homeless person live with me all human altruism doesn't exist? Ok dude.\n\nJust trying to understand your argument chief. Why the fuck are our streets full of homeless people if people are inherently altruistic. Something in your little equation is not adding up. Did you forget to carry a one?\n\n\n&gt;China, India and Brazil have also had massive reduction is poverty via state intervention, a decidedly non-capitalist phenomenon.\n\nWait are you actually being serious? The BRIC countries have benefitted unimaginably through capitalism and free trade. Where the fuck do you think the money that China spends comes from, precisely? \n\nState intervention is non-capitalist despite the fact that every single capitalist country engages in it? Ok.\n\n&gt;We also have the US, where the next generations are starting to become worse off than their parents, despite having higher income and where life expectancy is now lower than Cuba's\n\nNot sure what you're getting at here. Why the fuck would I be surprised that a society obsessed with booze and cheeseburgers and opioids would have decreasing lifespan.

Not well-liked, I thought it was alright; worth a watch and hey - Diane Lane.\n\n* Paranoia 1.0 - [2004] - Semi-obscure film with a lot of dark, weird atmospherics, about a programmer who is the victim of something.  Surprised I don't see this mentioned often.  Underrated.   Shot in a bizarre gothic building in Eastern Europe, but starring Jeremy Sisto.  Lance Henricksen shows up.\n\n* Jackrabbit - [2015] - The best computer-related independent film I know of.  Not specifically a hacker film, but lots of hacking together old computer parts in a post-apocalyptic scenario.\n\n* Hide and Seek - [1983] - The most Canadian hacker film there ever was, about an AI that lives in the wires.  Chock full of Commodore porn if that's your thing.  Based on the classic cybernovel, \"The Adolescence of P-1.\"  This was a made-for-TV film.  It deserves more serious treatment.  Here, an early 80s aesthetic is used.  In the novel, it was college students set in the middle 70s in the age of IBM 360s and the like.\n\n* Hackers - [1995] - the most ludicrous hacker film ever made; most people like it anyway and often because of that as opposed to in spite of it.  This movie is stupid and offensive to the intelligence of anyone who knows anything about computers.  A complete piece of shit, basically.  Highly recommended.\n\n* Computer Chess - [2013] - A computer chess tournament from around 1980 or 1981 is the setting for a movie whose plot is hard to describe; still, there is a scene involving rain on a computer that is notably beautiful, to me, at least.  Super indie, but excellent.\n\n* Paper Man - [1971] - While there are earlier movies about computers (like Desk Set), this is maybe the first hacker movie, about creating a fictional human being in computer databases.  Hard to find, with only rough rips available, it is an interesting watch.\n\n* Electric Dreams - [1984] - a computer fairy tale.  At the time it came out and in years that followed, a lot of computer nerds got so angry about this movie but I loved it from day one.  I still like it.  The most 80s computer film, stylistically, that exists.  Virginia Madsen is super pretty.  [Notable period soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1DwTcSlgqs).  Montage scenes made to look like a music video, it's quite enjoyable *if you don't take it so seriously you nerds - you know who you are.*\n\n* 23 - [1988] - The most German film about hackers ever made, this is about the German hackers who hacked a bunch of US systems and were hunted by Clifford Stoll in The Cuckoo's Egg.  This is told from the side of the Germans, and Robert Anton Wilson (!) in in this one.  Also some Commodore porn, including a Commodore SX-64 connecting to a VAX (!) via modem.\n\n* Pi - [1998] - Highly regarded film which involves computers but isn't...well, it's a psychological film.\n\n* Colossus: The Forbin Project - [1971] - The closest of all of these to Wargames, in that the stakes are high.  An American AI fights with a Russian AI.   This is one of those films that should be a lot more popular than it is.  Expensive-looking with a NORAD-like war room.\n\n* Demon Seed - [1977] - AI turns evil.\n\n* Desk Set - [1957] - a fact-checking department at a newspaper gets a UNIVAC-like computer system to automate things.  Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  Highly entertaining and interesting from the standpoint of holy shit a movie about computers in 1957.\n\n* Cyberbully - [2013] - a hacker tries to ruin a teenager's life.  Kind of a cautionary morality tale for our era rather than a thriller, the kid from Game of Thrones is in it.\n\nI like Wargames better than any of these, and I have a whole lot more computer-related films here (I collect them, specifically).

{"comment": "&gt; Oh ok, you want to use actual communist countries as an example to defend Communism?\n\nHow about you read that article of proto-communism again?\n\n&gt; Which murderous regime do you pick as an example for our discussion?\n\nHow about we discuss the genocidal effects of colonialism and imperialism, uniquely capitalist institutions?\n\n&gt; What in the flying fuck are you talking about? No communist country has ever operated on any level like this. In a communist country, the factory is run by an unaccountable friend of someone in the party. You're not accountable to your coworkers Jesus fucking Christ. You're accountable to an oligarch who is in the good graces of the partu. I find it hilarious that you want to move to the least accountable form of governance ever known to increase accountablility.\n\nSounds an awful lot like the capitalist mode of production to me. How about you engage with my argument rather than saying \"its never happened before so its impossible\". \n\n&gt; Ah yes the old \"science just doesn't understand my viewpoint argument\". Really popular with the flat Earth anti vax crowd.\n\nIts not that science doesn't understand, its that the field isn't asking that question. Modern behavioral science is concerned with how humans behave under the influence the current system, not in a 'natural state'. When anthropologists do look at how humans have behaved in the past, they find that behaviors were different from modern day.\n\n&gt; Why the fuck are our streets full of homeless people if people are inherently altruistic. Something in your little equation is not adding up.\n\nBecause the capitalist system incentivizes those in power to create and enlarge an underclass so they can extract even more profit from destitute laborers. The homelessness problem is a modern issue. In the past communities took care of those rendered homeless, but that goes away in a profit driven world.\n\n&gt; Wait are you actually being serious? The BRIC countries have benefitted unimaginably through capitalism and free trade. Where the fuck do you think the money that China spends comes from, precisely?\n\n[Market Socialism exists, read up on it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism) They benefited from markets but weren't dumb enough to leave the benefit in private hands for it to be misused and re-allocated it towards making their countries better.\n\n&gt; State intervention is non-capitalist despite the fact that every single capitalist country engages in it? Ok.\n\nYes, by definition it is. State intervention is a state taking capital out of private hands. Unless state ownership is also capitalist. Words have meaning.\n\n&gt; Not sure what you're getting at here. Why the fuck would I be surprised that a society obsessed with booze and cheeseburgers and opioids would have decreasing lifespan. American health problems are mostly self-inflicted cultural problems at this point. Stop eating cheeseburgers and start going to the gym and you'll fix this overnight.\n\nNone of these are unique to America, I suggest you get out of the house some more. Italy, Japan and the UK have far worse drinking cultures than the US and unhealthy food is no uniquely American.\n\n&gt; and opioids\n\nOh look, the effects of America trusting capitalist private industry with something as dangerous and important as the sale and marketing of dangerous, but effective, drugs. \n\nIf you want to tell the entirety of America to \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\" go ahead, but thinking that will work makes you more delusional than whatever straw-man communist you've got living rent-free in your head.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "news"}

He had posed as General Kreig for some years. This was before VM knew about the Conclave.\n\n**Umbrasyl** (Black) was the second to die. Vox Machina killed him in his layer atop Gatshadow Mt right outside the city of Westruun. (The city later reclaimed his entire treasure horde and during the same time the city was taken over by Grog's old tribe) Whe VM left they wrote something like \"One down four to go\" in Draconic right outside his layer and left a few dragon teeth\n\n**Vorugal** (White) was the third to die. VM killed him outside the ruins of Draconia (near Wildemount) They lured him to a valley that had an upside down U of ice cliffs. They killed him using a Goristro they summoned using a powerful scroll. Vex got the HDYWDT with her bow Fenthras. Whenever she kills things with her bow a magic tree starts to sprout from the corpse so if you are playing 20 years later it would be pretty big.\n\n**Thordak** (Red) was the fourth to die. He was killed at the former castle of Emon. Due to him being locked in the Elemental Plain of Fire for some many years it mutated him. He also had a huge gem in his chest that used to tie his soul to the plain. With his ties to the Plane Thordak's very presents in the city perminently changed the landscape of the city. By the time VM got to him Thordak had caused the entire castle district to be riddled with underground lava streams and a bunch of other Fire Elemental nasty things appeared. Vax shattered the gem and he was also the one to kill Thordak in his underground lair (Which Thordak had fled down when he knew he was gonna die. \n\n**Raishan** (Green) was the last to die. She had turned her back on the Conclave and actually assisted them in their final battle against Thordak. Stupidly immediately after the battle with Thordak Vax under Keyleth's urging attacked Raishan and a battle that killed Vex (she was immediately revived) and iirc also killed Vax (also saved) happened in Thordak's layer. Raishan barely escaped, teleporting away with (4?) Dragon Eggs which Thordak through asexual reproduction had layed. After the party rested up they teleported with Allura and Kima to Raishan's base an old Necromancers island which has a shit ton of lore. You should really watch that episode its got a lot going on. Keyleth cast Feebalmind on Raishan which worked, this prevented her from casting anymore spells. After a party member death Raishan was killed and iirc the party caved in the chamber so no one could ever use the Necromancers knowledge again.\n\nIf you are doing a Chroma Conclave Arc in your campaign your players should eventually run into Allura and Kima, their old party of adventurers were the one to seal Thordak in the Plane of Fire and they both felt extreme guilt and responsibility to what had happened. Also, Thordak was the dragon that killed the twins mother.\n\nHope this helps!", "score": 45, "subreddit": "criticalrole"}
{"comment": "Lemme apologize up front for length.\n\n&gt;People who are anti-vaxx typically have a less than perfect understanding of diseases and the related sciences.\n\nI think this moves the goal post quite a lot. Obviously in order to be anti-vax one necessarily must misunderstand some of the science, but they don\u2019t as a whole not subscribe to the germ theory of disease. In fact, AFAIK the anti vax orgs don\u2019t even dispute that vaccines work as described, just would add that the \u2018cause autism\u2019 or other illness too. This seems completely unrelated to Columbus who thought that disease was transmitted via bad smells, about which not even the best scientists at the time would disagree. The standard shouldn\u2019t be \u201cdo people have a less than perfect understanding\u201d of the consequences of their action, and in fact, isn\u2019t. The standard under the law is what a \u201creasonable person\u201d would or should know, when it comes to negligent acts (see below I guess), and I think that\u2019s good.\n\n&gt; In your view, if your neighbor kisses someone who they know has the flu and then accidentally passes it on to you, would you be able to charge them for assault? What if they don't know that person has the flu? Is that not the scaled down version of this crime?\n\nFirst, I maintain the flu is a bad comparison here. The flu is neither particularly deadly (unless very old, young, or infirm), nor entirely preventable via vaccination.  \nSecond, if they intentionally expose themselves to the flu, setting the law aside, yeah I would say they bear a smidge of responsibility if they then gave it to me, even accidentally. I don\u2019t think that that rises to criminality for a lot of reasons though. Do you not think they have *any* responsibility?  \nThird, I don\u2019t mean to criticize your usage, but just to be clear, assault is the threat of battery. Battery is the act of causing (unlawful) physical harm specifically via touching/physical contact, so that also doesn\u2019t apply, but even stretching the definition a bit, both things require intent, and so neither would apply here, to accidentally transmitting the flu (nor should they apply in my ideal gov). Thomas Miguel Guerra, the guy who was convicted after intentionally transmitting HIV, for instance, was tried under a specific CA health code, not a normal criminal code.\n\nIt might help to clarify what I meant by bringing up manslaughter vs murder. Both are kinds of intentional homicide, with murder involving \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d, and manslaughter not. But a \u201cdeath that occurs without intent to cause serious physical injury, but where reckless conduct by the defendant resulted in death\u201d is still manslaughter.\n\nThe reason I brought this comparison up before, is cuz I think it\u2019s all fine and good for Columbus, if charged with some not-yet-extant crime, to say \u2018hey, I didn\u2019t know, and in fact couldn\u2019t have known, that my actions would cause death\u2019. That makes sense. He isn\u2019t guilty because he didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t have foreseen the consequences. But if an antivaxer says \u201cI didn\u2019t know my not getting the measles vaccine would mean I could give people measles\u201d then (a) I mostly don\u2019t believe them and (b) who cares what they say they knew, people bent over backwards to inform them, and made the vaccine readily available, so they SHOULD have know. They were being reckless, and so are culpable.\n\nThe issue of course is you can\u2019t charge a specific person with this kinda crime afterwards. If I got measles (or the flu or whatever) there\u2019s no good way to tell who gave it to me. THIS is why a law requiring vaccinations is pretty necessary. It would uphold first principles, with minimal possible government input/control.\n\n&gt;As far as not trusting the government\n\nLook, we\u2019re both talking on a libertarian forum. You don\u2019t need to convince me to not trust the gov. I\u2019m actually curious if you mean the tuskeegee experiment (which wasn\u2019t sterilization?) or the sterilization of inmates and asylum residents (which wasn\u2019t disguised as medicine?), but the government is obviously to blame in both places. I am skeptical of 2 though.

There really was no one exactly like her in the mainstream at that time. And when she came out with her own line, it was only natural that I would love it and I did. Her first lipsticks in the sliver tubes were some of the best I used. I absolutely loved her eye shadows and even bought some as gifts for people. I felt like for the quality it was worth the price. She was the first brand I went to Sephora for even. I felt like she was an innovator when it came to makeup. Her vibrant colors, the themes of her palettes and the design really made her stuff distinctive and exciting. \n\nAfter she became a vegan, I noticed there was a shift in her brand. She started to identify her company as vegan. Hired her collective (which I heard if they were going to work for her they had to be vegan as well, so they had to become vegans and that rubbed me the wrong way) I felt like the quality of her products changed then. The lipsticks sucked so I stopped buying them. She tied her activism with her brand. Which to be honest, I wasn't really interested in. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, because it was her company and she could market it however she wanted. But, it just did not interest me. Tying a company with a social and ethical belief can be tricky. At times I felt like she was a little too preachy. I occasionally would buy her eyeliner but, I duped with with NYX and I pretty much stopped buying her stuff after that. And it's only natural that more boutique style brands came out into the scene and her brand to me, kinda felt stale. (I'm not trying to hate on veganism or be negative about it, but, it's just what I noticed.)\n\nI think the start of the end is was her anti vaxx message, the member of her collective Kelsey leaving the team. (Which I had heard was because of some austim related things that Kat aligned with resulting from vaccinations and Kelsey admitting she was on the spectrum.) She got sooo much negative attention for that post, I'm sure she regrets it now. So many people stopped supporting her brand and boycotted her. And her brand became associated with anti-science propaganda and she herself being problematic with her past and her current husband's past. \n\nIn the end I think she was losing money and could not really build back up her brand reputation. No one talked about her stuff anymore. I even would see her products at T.J. Maxx. Which was so strange. It is sad though because at one point I could not get enough of her products but, it's been years since I purchased one.", "score": 52, "subreddit": "BeautyGuruChatter"}

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI find people who post their entire life story online fascinating. I have a facebook friend from my hometown that is the epitome of a boss babe mom. Her descent into idiocy is a slow but entertaining thing to watch. Over the years I've made it a habit to pop onto her page from time to time and see which MLM scam she's losing her husband\u2019s money to. Or which of her five children has a weird disease that she can extort for likes or to shill some natural remedy to her mindless followers. Every failure filled me with joy. \n\nRecently, she joined a new MLM  early, and it\u2019s a hit. She is successful. I know people will doubt this, but I still work in the town she lives in. New home-new car. It's uncommon, but the top of the pyramid can be very lucrative - and in my opinion, that money comes from scamming others. I loathe MLM's and everything they stand for. This woman - who has such cruel opinions on autistic children, the lgbtq community, and  anyone that is different, is now rolling in money and influence. \n\nI mentioned the descent into idiocy - well, here is where it becomes more of a free fall. She decides that her son is autistic - this is denied by multiple doctors before a homeopathic doctor confirms it. It\u2019s obviously caused by vaccines, guys. So, this insane woman - who now has followers and money and influence, is using all of her efforts to fight against vaccines. She starts posting daily about the dangers. #readtheinserts. How they cause not only autism, but are responsible for the rise in depression and increase in the trans community. \n\nI can't fight her. Obviously. But one day, on a whim, I report her post as false information to facebook. The next day, when I check her page, I see she\u2019s in \u2018facebook jail\u2019. It\u2019s nice to know that I stopped her, even just for a day. So I do it the next day, on her daily anti vax rant. Again, she is blocked. Her posts on the days she isn\u2019t blocked are slowly getting fewer likes or comments. She\u2019s never active for more than a day, because she just keeps posting false information, and well, I keep reporting it. Finally she posts a plea to the person reporting her. Facebook is her lifeline. She can't manage her 'business' without access to the site.  She has young children to provide for and she uses facebook to spread her business. I guess I'm starting to wonder if her and her supporters aren't right. \n\nI know it\u2019s not normal to check someone\u2019s profile daily, a person you hardly know, or to get so involved in fighting against her cause having never confronted her on it face to face. But I can't seem to stop. This is how I chose to fight her influence. I report her. And she essentially lives in facebook jail. So, I\u2019m interested in seeing what you guys think. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop either way, but the more I think about it, the more I wonder if ITA?\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"comment": "I literally see this in every comment on reddit and YouTube. Funny how I've never read a single story of groups of unvaccinated people falling dead in modern society. \n\nPersonally I know 11 unvaccined people, two being myself and my wife. None of us have ever had more than the common cold and chicken pox.  We all have college degrees. And we are all quite athletic with the exception of one. \n\nMy wife and I competed at the National level of Powerlifting. Her brother is a semi professional soccer player and other brother was a stand out football player in high school along with a black belt in jujitsu. Her little cousin is in elementary school and as healthy as can be. \n\nMy sister was never into athletics but always very healthy. She has a great job and great life.\n\nI  have 3 friends who are unvaccinated. All 3 were cross country runners and 2 out of 3 ran sub 16 minute 5ks in high school. The other was in the 16s.. One went on to run 4 years at a university and is now in med school. The other two have college degrees and successful jobs.\n\nThe final 2 are my cousins kids. Both in school, athletes, and healthy as can be.\n\nSo before you reply with some absurdly ignorant comment such as, \"duh you can't look at personal evidence and that's 11 people. You do know there's like 336 million people in the US right?.. Or you're just lucky you aren't all dead... Or you aren't an MD or scientist so your opinion doesn't matter and  you can't talk... Or you're just an anti vaxx idiot\" just know, that this is the weakest part of my argument. I've read more studies, books, watched more videos, and am far more educated on this topic than you.\n\nSide note. I also have one more personal story of an aunt with a perfectly healthy young son. Until he got the MMR vaccine. Then he got autism. Just like every other story you hear \"soccer moms and Karen's\" talk about online. But I'm sure you believe all these hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of parents, who don't know each other, are all in the lie together. I mean they have so much to gain by being excluded from society and being hated by their peers, simply for thinking that vaccines may have been responsible for their healthy child losing all cognitive abilities. \n\nBut hey I love making people look stupid on the internet, so by all means, please try to debate.\n\nIn4b \"haha anti-vaxx idiot the only one you're making look stupid is yourself haha lol haha\"", "score": 1, "subreddit": "conspiracy"}

{"comment": "&gt;How is it do you think that someone could continue to believe in such things, rejecting all evidence to disprove their theory and concocting their own evidence to refute everyone else?\n\nI think believing something outside of mainstream thought is usually going to stem from a confluence of a number of characteristics/circumstances. I think that people who simply object to things that are really observational in nature and can be discerned literally through an application of basic senses from the correct perspective are usually people who are bored or lonely/isolated and seek companionship. They find a contrived idea with some sort of niche following and simply glom on and adopt those beliefs. I think this type of person is usually intellectually curious about the world around him, but there's a strong desire to protect himself from isolation. This is totally armchair psychology, but that's just my thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen talking about more complicated things like anti-vaxxers, these are people who simply lack trust in institutions.

The chemistry isn't there, for me, and most of the characters aren't very compelling to me.   \nLiam is maudlin, again and this time without the occasional playfulness that Vax had, Travis has taken a major back seat to the degree of becoming a wallflower, Ashley has been there for what, a third of the episodes and is playing the least zealous zealot barbarian I've ever seen, Laura's fallen into the most grating kind of Chaotic Neutral, Marisha is playing one of the least pleasant or interesting characters I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing and her entire arc boils down to petty daddy issues, Taliesin is doing \\*fine\\*, even if Caduceus is the purest definition I've seen of a character made to spite the DM (\"Oh, Molly died?

{"comment": "I've had this idea for a while now when you comes to the characters for both campaigns in that my observation is that the C1 characters more closely reflect the individual cast members whereas the C2 characters are intentionally distanced from the personalities of the cast.\n\nBecause they played at home sporadically before the stream, the C1 characters are archetypal in nature. Grog is the classic barbarian, Scanlan is the quintessential bard, Pike is the kind cleric, etc. Obviously there is more to each character, especially as C1 raises in stakes and drama, but the cast has stated that these characters were really fleshed out in the midst of the stream. The only character that really breaks this mold is Keyleth, and Marisha has said that she deliberately made Keyleth someone vastly different to herself as an exercise and experiment.\n\nIn C2, the rest of the cast make characters that mimic Marisha's attempts with Keyleth as Caleb is cautious while Vax was reckless, Fjord is calculating and low-key in relation to Grog, Scanlan is a charismatic gnome that hates goblins and som Nott is an uncharismatic goblin, and so forth.\n\nMarisha obviously made Beau as a rough street brawler more in line with herself than Keyleth ever was, and i also noticed that this pattern follows every cast member whose intro to DnD was through Matt while Taliesin, the most experienced player, makes characters as a veteran of tabletop RPGs would. Percy, Molly, and Cad are wildly different and I think that everyone has picked up on the depth of experience that Taliesin brings to each character. I'm immensely fascinated whenever backstory for his characters are revealed.\n\n**TLDR**: C1 characters are the cast members slightly modified for fantasyland, C2 characters are an acting project for each member.

If you wish to drop sources drop some pubmed papers on dog behavior/behavioral therapy on me I\u2019m not 12...\n\nSecond on the contrary I had two dogs growing up, a border collie that passed at 10 and a Jack Russell that\u2019s still kicking today at 16. The Jack was the alpha between the two but I was still the alpha between the three. Any form of submission they showed me when I required them to submit was never met with a grin or smile, if they were harassing another dog on our walks and I shouted they would put their tails between their legs like every other dog. \n\nThirdly I would like you to stop spreading misinformation that could accidentally cause someone to misinterpret a dogs body language as something they recognize. That is incredibly dangerous on par of anti vax parents. The muscles in a dogs face do not permit it to smile, they permit it to pant. The brain in a dogs head does not have the capacity to allow the dog to understand what a smile is and what situations it is called for. Your brain is filling in the blanks by personifying an animal with characteristics that are inherently human. That is the dangerous thing I am trying to address, because someone down the line will read that and think their dog is smiling at them and happy when they are actually panting and distressed. \n\nFourthly if an animal is on the table to be euthanized I\u2019m sure misinterpreting a \u201csmile\u201d had nothing to do with it (obviously I\u2019m not going to address kill shelters because that\u2019s another moral dilemma).

{"comment": "Unfortunately that's not correct, plenty of money is made, the main reason for all flat earth and antivaxx getting popular is YouTube. \n\nBare with me here as it seems a reach but it makes sense I promise... both youtube and pornhub have algorithms to help with getting your video seen if it gets traction. \n\nJust to set an example, it's very common knowledge that for some reason incest porn is MASSIVELY popular on all pornsites now, on any sites homepage they are always trending, and there is a reason for this. A few years ago, everything is normal, mainstream porn most popular, all the rest less so as it becomes more and more specialist. Then one day an aspiring amateur couple who made successful content anyway, upload an incest roleplay video with very minimal inferred incest, as that's fucking gross, but the woman is very attractive and they make lots of roleplay content and their content is popular for amateurs anyway they have a few hundred thousand views per video and a few million hit ones so pornhub is helping them with its algorithm. BOOM. it gets something retarded like 35 million views. Pornhub pays something like 0.69 dollars per 1k views. That's like $25k for 1 days work.\n\nThis is because its content most people would have viewed anyway purely because of its content, BUT it has the clickbait title shock value of incest which obviously nobody would want to watch. But because of that, as it hits the trending bar, EVERYONE was clicking on it like WTF an incest video is trending? It explodes as everyone is curious of the ridiculous viewcount and its contents, which turn out just to be a good normal video witha hot chick just doing what she always did but with a title that that caused alot of controversy. \n\nBecause both pornhub and youtube have thier own ecosystems of content creators constantly looking to take advantage of the algorithm, very quickly to take advantage of the new trending keyword, other vanilla creators big and small start uploading thier normal content with incest keywords and titles to cash in too. More and more go viral off the back of the first one causing all the controversy. More people do it and more people do it, more views made etc etc everyone's making money from the new keywords that nobody was using before.\n\nNow pornsites as an industry are all fucked up, as half the fucking content now is mother/son sister/brother daddy/daughter bullshit but it's all just regular porn, trying to boost itself with algorithm keywords as the system pushes alot of it now because it thinks people want to watch it. NOBODY watches it and gets off on the thought of having sex with thier own family members, people watch it because it has thier favourite stars in, or the thumbnail looks good. Now it's just a wierd phenomenon that happened and now has planted itself so far in the mainstream that big production channels do the same thing propagating it even further because everyone likes money, and now people dont even realise the title half the time.\n\nNow to get to the original point, conspiracy videos are very popular on youtube for a reason. You make something talking about chemtrails or the elite all being paedophiles or aliens control us etc, and you put effort into the production quality of the video, your going to get views, and views on youtube make money.\n\nOne day some dude (or dudette) just goes all in, he gets the most retarded thing he can think off, as people can argue about moon landings and government conspiracies all day. Got to go deeper. Flat earth. That will do it. Makes a high production video about flat earth, boom hundreds of thousands of views, as your getting the normal conspiracy crowd but your ALSO bringing in all the normies seeing it trend and clicking while going NOOO FUCKING WAY WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT. But you gave them the click. This propagates it further. YouTube sees it's new keywords that's getting lots of interaction in the comments so pushes it further in algorithm as interactive viewers mean they can charge more for advertising and the creator gets a cut.\n\nAs mentioned earlier pornhub can pay around .69dollars per 1k views, youtube can pay 1$ anywhere up to 10$ per more depending how friendly and inoffensive the content is. So the person makes a few thousand dollars or so for a day of editing a silly video. He makes another one. And another one, like any new trend you get diminishing returns. He then uses Facebook posts and videos to stir things up, as everyone likes arguing about pointless shit on Facebook, but links everything back to his youtube video. More money. Then other people see what's happening and make thier own. YouTube is like a small pool infested with piranhas, if one person trends with any type of new content or keyword, it turns into a fucking frenzy. Every mummy blogger, let's player, toy reviewer, cooking channel... start to upload horseshit low quality content loosely tied to the new flat earth keyword with some crappy clickbait thumbnail. Nobody believes in flat earth, especially the people making the content, but its allowing some easy money to be made until the algorithm balances out. Same thing happened with anti vax, made a huge wave on blogs and social media and youtube because it was so ridiculous it was making alot of clicks just from cringe factor, but alot of people made money from it, some made alot but the bulk of it is the thousands of shitty bloggers and youtubers shitting out content just to make $5-$10 just jamming the internet with it trying to squeeze the money out. \n\nThen to make it even worse, because of this new trend that's ridiculous BUT getting clicks, minor celebrities jump on the band wagon too, as it just gets them talked about, they might be able to cash in on a few more interviews or whatever. The same reason people get pictures of themselves visiting kids with cancer. Because they know it's easy clicks. Celebs feeds the system again, which influences more dumb people because they saw some z list celeb foaming for attention claiming they are woke, but they are just playing stupid people, the famous dont get paid directly, but they hope to make money from more exposure, being asked onto interviews and podcasts explaining why they are a total retard.\n\nBut unlike what happened with the incest porn example, a new phenomenon occurs with flat earth and anti vaxxers that nobody predicted: People are really fucking stupid. \n\nSo then the problem compounds on itself. You get people that are paranoid schizophrenics, mentally unstable people, unemployed people that do too many drugs and just general total muppets watch and read alot of it especially the pretend documentaries and get totally converted. Then THEY start making posts and content, but it's a new wave because nobody even knows you can monetise it, it's just more spam. Other conspiracies didnt work, but flat earth and anti vax, the most retarded shit of all, crystallised all of the most extreme numptys under 1 banner, and it basically resulted in irreparable damage to the internet that is now self sustaining.\n\nAnti vaxx is the same, alot of people for some reason are put off by a doctor telling them medical advice that has taken them a lifetime to accumulate, maybe it's that the doctor is successful? Or an anti authority thing? But either way some people for some reason would rather listen to a fat mum on facebook or a white skinny dude on youtube with dreads telling them how bleach enemas have made him healthier even though hes making the videos from a clearly visible shithole in Thailand as that's the only place his 4 videos a day that only make a few hundred views each can stretch enough income to survive, for some reason it just makes some people feel better. We live in a wierd time where the snake oil salesman dont even need to sell you anything anymore, they just need you to watch thier videos. Which then feeds into money, which gets back to your question, yes, there is lots of money to be made.\n\nThat's a long ass post, if you get to the end i congratulate you. None of this is also taking into account that I once watched on YouTube an hour and a half long panel at a flat earth convention of the so called experts, 5 random people all sitting and they just had one big entirely misinformed conversation on microphone with eachother, to a huge crowd of people I ASSUME paid to be there, so someone made money running the event and paid them to speak. After the talk of which absolutely nothing of any substance was gone over, each of them were given a couple of minutes to plug thier new book to buy.\n\nSo they have books out there. When they opened up for questions, some of the q's were from edgy non believers trying to disprove, but they had paid to get in, and thier arguments just fuel everything so they are just as bad. It's like religion as long as your arguing with them you look just as retarded as they are, it's like trying to eat a banana and look cool it just cant be done, the best thing you can do is just ignore them. Some other people that lined up for questions clearly had degrees of mental handicapping, and 2 people that asked questions actually cried because they were so scared the world was watching them and closing in on them through the government for knowing this info, both of those people didnt seem to be slow or dumb, but both clearly had had some kind of breakdown in thier lives resulting in being fucking nuts. As far as I'm concerned those people are a cross section of everyone at the event, haters, mentally challenged, and people that are just fucking broken, all being massively taken advantage of, same with anti vaxx movement. \n\nTldr, there is alot of money to be made.", "score": 323, "subreddit": "videos"}

I've been watching Del Bigtree's show Highwire (an \"anti-vax\" show), and taking notes, then going back to the pro-vax side and seeing their take.  \n  \nBottom line is that the vaccine safety studies you were told about do not live up to the minimal standards for approving pharmaceutical products. A boner drug, or Vioxx (which killed a lot of people), or lipitor or anti-depressants all go through studies to look for adverse events by using inert placebo controls. Vaccines are the one area of medicine exempt from this standard of science, and I might point out that this standard of having placebo controls is just a minimum. Even with placebo controls for safety, it happens often in pharmaceutical research that studies with unfavorable outcomes never get published, so there is publication bias. Then even among the studies where something worked or kinda worked, they can massage and manipulate the data, and even when the data in a paper is bad, the summary and conclusions will paint a rosy picture of the lackluster results.  \n  \nI'm not saying all science is trash. Far from it. But you have to take into account motives, etc. My (evolving) belief is that many public health professionals don't want to see anything published that causes a loss of confidence in vaccines. The drug companies have the same goal as well.  \n  \nSome things I've learned on this journey: there are a lot of doctors, health professionals, and scientific data and historical data to support many claims made by the anti-vax side.  \n  \nMy son will soon get a recommendation to have the gardasil HPV vaccine, and as of right now, I would not have him do it until I learn more. But in the case of gardasil I doubt I will change my mind. I have already verified for myself the shady presentation of the placebo groups and dug into the safety data at clinical trials dot gov.  \n  \nGood luck in your pursuit of this topic.

It says that people vaccinated with the DTaP vaccine were more likely to catch and spread pertussis than people vaccinated with the DTwP vaccine.\n\nDTaP is an acellular vaccine and doesn't contain whole Pertussis bacteria cells where as DTwP is a whole cell vaccine.\n\nWhole cell vaccines are more variable in efficacy and have more immediate side effects than acellular ones.\n\n\"Whole-cell vaccines contain inactivated B. pertussis organisms and a variable but significant amount of endotoxin, which is probably responsible for the relatively high rate of fever, local reactions, pain and prolonged crying from whole-cell vaccine\"\n\nhttps://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-1998-cdi2207-cdi2207a.htm\n\nAlso as you can clearly see here, the incidence of Pertussis is way WAY down on what it used to be, even with the change to the less effective vaccine.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html\n\n&gt; Here's what was known wayy back in 1998, that vaccines cause brain damage including regressive autism.\n\nbetween 1970 and 1993\n\nA total of 48 children\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis clustering **suggests** that a causal relationship between measles vaccine and encephalopathy **may** exist as a **rare** complication of measles immunization.\n\n48 cases in 23 years.... that's 2 per year.

Royal Rife, electromedicine, Gerson, iboga, etc.  the establishment protects itself and uses appeal to (broken) authority as one of its go to moves.  the \"heroic system\" smells are manifold.  \n\nin terms of vax, it has suffered from many avoidable problems.  here's just a small list.  lack of longitudinal studies.  multiplexing payloads (which increases the number of combinations, and thus bad combinations.  for instance 1 shot = 1 combo, 2 = 2 x 1 = 2, 3 = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6, 4 = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24, 5 = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120, 6 = 720, etc.  just think about this pattern.  and that's just assuming the \"machinery\" of complication is just the number of payloads.  in reality it's not.  in reality the \"machinery\" includes the person's individual variances).  extremely bad QA.  examples of live virus in samples that should have none. sketchy pandemics and adulterated vax for these cases that the QA completely misses.  examples of vax not containing what it should (the pet vax analysis stuff here is shocking).  policy protecting the manufacturers.  it goes on and on and on.  honestly you can spend years on this rabbit hole.  i have.   it's a shit show.  it has smells of a massive depopulation effort, like so many other things in the medical domain.   \n\nvax itself will not work for everyone.  it can't.  those people it doesn't work with it may cause long term or life long problems.  it selects for those it's compatible with.  over time it will manifest as a monoculture-y selective pressure, which may provide some clues as to who it actually benefits.\n\nanyway, i personally don't trust it at all.  read the forums.  dig into the subject.  it's eye opening.", "score": 11, "subreddit": "conspiracy"}

{"comment": "Autism is a neurotype, a way the brain is wired that comes with so much more than inability to pick up social cues and difficulties socializing; sensory processing issues, problems with executive functioning, \"can't see the forest for the trees\" detail orientedness, just do name a few. There is data, anecdotal and peed reviewed, that shows the best way to make it less difficult for autistic children to interact with their non autistic (allistic) peers, is to explain to each group/individual that the other may be different or interact differently, what they can likely expect from the others(Bobby might not look you in the eye while playing, Timmy might talk more than you), and that it's normal for people to not all be the same. Autistic people don't have to change everything about ourselves to play nice with others, most if not all of us work quite hard to wrap our minds around allistic social norms, and some reciprocity in understanding goes far!\n\nSome challenges that often come with being autistic, such as working with and around executive dysfunction, can be to a certain extent worked on in a professional therapy setting so one can function better day to day. However ABA \"therapy\" is exactly what the person you responded to said, it's goal is not to better quality of life but rather to make the autistic child as *normal as possible* utilizing methods that are unquestionably damaging. The child's comfort and well-being are not paramount, and the tactics they use are indeed comparable with conversion therapies and even types of dog training. Many autistic people who have endured it and former practitioners who now condemn it attest that the training ABA puts children through effectively sets them up to be compliant abuse victims in the future, teaching them to ignore feelings of discomfort and their own bodies warning signs, to obey anyone who has authority over you or 'knows better' than you. If you do not do something correctly or ask for something in the exact way they want you to you can be denied food, restroom access, affection or attention, even taking away comfort object or toys without explanation when the child does not comprehend what they are being punished for, because not doing exactly as the \"therapist\" wants is considered defiant behavior. All of this creates a learned helplessness and is encouraged as a way to \"train\" the child into normalcy, and \"break\" them of the \"bad habits\" of autism, most of which are value neutral differences rather than real behavioral problems. For example, communicating in non standard ways even if they are conveying meaning perfectly well such as ecolalia or gesture, not making eye contact, not playing with toys in a conventional manner.\n\nABA as an institution goes hand in hand with Autism $peaks(A$) and \"Autism Mom's\", who are not outliers but very much the norm. These types of people, organizations, and \"therapies\" encourage parents to continue to think of their child as a burden, as broken, as a \"shell\" of a person and the autism has robbed them of their true child, or conversely, that their true child is \"trapped\" in there underneath the autism. They say cruel dismissive things directly in front of their children as if they cannot understand them, there are many A$ videos where parents speak publicly with their child/children there saying such things that they wish their child had never been born, that they considered killing them for the sake of their other children, that autism stole their child, things that should never be said outside private therapy or support groups, let alone in front of the child you're speaking about. Many also support and act on incredibly dangerous and abusive attempts at \"curing\" autistic children, such as bleach enemas, feeding them essential oils, \"packing\", and chelation. \n\nPoint being, ABA is a harmful practice, Autism Mom's exist in surprisingly large numbers and are as a group pretty much responsible for the anti vaxx movement fwiw due to a widespread wholly inaccurate belief that the mercury in vaccines cause autism, and the others who have responded to you preciously are quite correct in their statements.", "score": 57, "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole"}

There is some crazy anti vax people, who would probably have those dumbs parties to spread it around. \n\nBut there is better sanitation, state of the art health care, and better quarantine. Even with so many without health care, rather you can afford it or not, I believe you\u2019ll be quarantined none the less. \n\nThough there are those that have weakened immune systems. Cancer, and autoimmune disorders, where medications are used to weaken the immune system. \n\nSame for Europe I\u2019m guessing. \n\nEurope, US, and Canada won\u2019t play around and take this very seriously. They will track down those who are infected or possibly infected. \n\nI\u2019m sure WHO and CDC are already working on controlling the virus, along with working on a possible cure/vaccination. \n\nIf a vaccination becomes possible, this is one I hope they mandate as mandatory and vaccinate even anti-vaxxers against their will. \n\nHopefully not long after all this, vaccinations will become mandatory. I hate government meddling and impending upon our freedoms as much as the next person, but I\u2019m hoping this will serve as a lesson.\n\nIt\u2019s important during this to always wash your hands. Try to limit touching your face. If the virus reaches your area, wear a mask and probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to wear gloves. Along with when going out and once you reaching your house, to take off all your clothes immediately and place into the washer. Then wash your hands, then take a shower. \n\nI think doing this will most likely help to keep you from getting sick or at least limiting your exposure. Which is always important in an outbreak. To limit your exposure. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a report of 14 day incubation, so once it\u2019s reaches your state, I would go ahead and start with what I\u2019ve said. \n\nI would also look up other ways to help limit your exposure and staying as germ free as you can. \n\nPossibly getting the flu vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination may help as well. So your immune system won\u2019t be weak and increase chances of infection. \n\nI\u2019m not a doctor or any health professional. Just someone who is slightly paranoid of viral and bacterial infections, as someone who has a weakened immune system due to SLE Lupus. I take immune suppressants in order to keep it in control. \n\nIf you are a child of an anti vax parent, I would start seeking ways to get/start vaccinations.\n\nAlso limiting eating out would help as well. Some workers still work in the food industry when they are sick or even during an incubation period, where they don\u2019t know they are sick yet. \n\nBe sure to cook your food to proper temperatures. Always wash your fruit and veggies throughly. If you want to go full blown paranoia when the virus is in your area or you are sure a food item was shipped from or through an infection area, wipe down cans and boxes with a bleach wipe.\n\nDo not pick at scabs, or pick at pimples. Properly clean an cut or open wound. Apply antibiotic gel, and then cover with a bandage. Depending on bandage, change daily, and clean, apply more gel to promote faster healing and then recover. \n\nIf I think of more ways, I will keep updating my comment.    \n\nEdit: To clarify, my immune system isn\u2019t weak because of Lupus. It is a cause of it because of the medications I take, immune suppressants, to make my immune system weaker.\n\n2nd Edit: Obviously don\u2019t travel to those areas. If the virus comes into your area, limit your own travel and touching public surfaces. If someone coughs, no matter who they are, put some space between you and them if at all possible. Same for sneezing, puke, etc. \n\nTry to not be in enclosed areas. Try to put as much space between between you and others as you can.", "score": 30, "subreddit": "teenagers"}

And the last few times we\u2019ve spoken she gets angry that I won\u2019t accept that \u201cthe Jews\u201d control all the banks and media and politics and are working to have us all killed off (for... reasons?) The very last time we spoke she started talking about how \u201cthe gays\u201d are working to legalize child rape because they\u2019re all mentally deranged people who only exist because of liberal ideas, and they all need to be stopped. I couldn\u2019t even continue the conversation. My cousin - her own daughter - is gay. One of her (now former) best friends is gay.\n\nI used to calmly push back and offer counterpoints or evidence but at this stage she won\u2019t even accept anything that isn\u2019t right-wing extremist propaganda. She shouts down anybody who disagrees. I\u2019m probably the only family member who keeps in touch anymore, albeit loosely, and I loved who she was for so long in my life, but at this point that person is gone, I\u2019m afraid. She\u2019s so full of hatred and her head is so full of propaganda that she has become unrecognizable.\n\nUntil the rabbit hole of alt right media, she was not this kind of person. She never once said anything remotely racist, and (aside from my grandma once in awhile making a sort of ignorant comment about Asians) my grandparents never did either. This was not part of her upbringing. She had gay friends and Jewish friends and several people of color in her life, and she has since lost touch with them (obviously). She\u2018s living off social security now and so she just sits in her house watching this shit and getting drunk and angry and chatting online with people who share these deeply fucked up views. \n\nOverall, it happened FAST.

Well, GC ideology runs into all of the same pit falls as conversion therapy with its approach to trans kids.

In the explanation, it admits that VAX on it's own is regressive (\" Though regressive on it's own \") and I do agree that with UBI its relatively progressive. But do not argue that on its own his VAT is not regressive.\n\nFor Bernies tax plan. The first TAX bracket that is increased by Bernie is for those making over 250, 000 dollars. Those making less than 29,000 will pay NO new taxes and those between those 2 numbers only a 4% new M4A tax. For anyone making below somewhere around 100,000ish (MOST AMERICANS) a year, this will mean savings because of the medical savings alone.\n\nAnd I read most of Yang's healthcare plan and I am confused... like honestly, it seems very unspecific. While he claims to be for M4A, how does he want to pay for it?\n\nAnd well from the left-wing I can give some really strong criticism on foreign policy and climate of Yang. While I think I lie really close to him, he openly rejects socialism so yes, as a socialist I think I can make valid criticism (But I understand the lack of value of criticizing Yang for not nationalizing the railway industry etc., I know most Americans don't see the value of that).

{"comment": "&gt;yet this character hasn't even changed enough to stop doing the blatantly immoral stuff they had to do previously and now don't\n\nPaladins dont have to be moral. They have to have convictions. I didnt add much cus, well, it was going to be a short post. The paladin portion wouldve been years of physical and mental training to make them capable of following said convictions, and the casting came as a result of that. There is nothing to say that an ex thief paladin cant maintain proficiency in thieves tools and while I dont picture this character continuing to steal, I can see them keeping up on their practices so they dont lose their skill. Being able to pick locks is something even a law abiding person can make use of. I wouldn't even call stealing food to survive to be blatantly immoral, and that would've stopped with home security. \n\n\n&gt;And then, where does the ability to contact The Raven Queen come from?\n\n2 options. 1, this guy dies and the RQ sends them back for bidding. Option 2, someone close to this guy dies and this guy makes a deal. The RQ is in charge of and involved in ushering souls to the afterlife. Theres lots of ways to potentially go about it. Of course it sounds hand waved, I only included a few half sentences. In investing more, I'd probably say that the lover of this guy died and was a RQ cleric defending a RQ temple or holy place at the side of our guy. Lots of RQ influence in both the event and the area. I'd probably word it as something akin to what happened to Vax in Critical Role. \n\n&gt;2 years to become a ranger?\n\nFrom the time as a rogue and the levels and the skills that I personally would pick out from starting in rogue, this guy would already function similarly to a ranger, honestly probably better in the tracking and perception department (expertise and a proficiency of more than +2). Its been more than 2 years for most of the basic flavor, it's been their lifetime. The favored enemy and terrain would come from years of almost exclusively fighting in this terrain and against undead. The mentor would've basically been there to help with survival and to train in the subclass. The only things gained are class abilities that'll probably never come in handy, a few good subclass abilities and spells. Most of the major training for proficiencies are already taken care of as a rogue/paladin. \n\n&gt;Imagine a full ranger, whose backstory is that they grew up in the wilds after their elven city in the wilderness was burned down by a dragon. Somehow, despite them growing up in the wilderness for 10+ years, using that time to live and learn about the creature they hope to eventually gain revenge on, they've many of the exact same ranger abilities as the dude who spent 2 years there.\n\nOP can change the time to 10 years. I dont care. But when a person is stuck in a terrain for more than a year, they learn how it works. They learn how to read the land, predict its behaviors and deal with the animals. It's either that or they die. For the enemies, you can get a lot done in also only a year. Depending on what the are, you could constantly practice against said enemy type or do a heck ton of research. Honestly, with your 10+ years, this ranger would already be behind this build without the ranger levels for the reasoning of proficiency alone. If you expect 10 years to get 1 level in a class, well, I guess no one is ever going to multiclass. This build already has all of the proficiencies checked off.\n\nIn theory, you could get a character to level 20 in just under 3 weeks (although itd never happen, most people like some story in their combat).

Anyhow, all of these studies are funded by pharmaceutical companies who make billions a month from vaccines.. Weird.. they support vaccines? Ofc they do, they need to protect vaccines from criticism.

Autism is barely understood, but they believe now that it is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. There are clear links between immune activation and neurological issues. As well as links between heavy metals and autism. \n\nAutism is a complex range of Neurological developmental disorders the current rates of autism are 1 in 59 according to the CDC some studies show as high as 1 in 34. Autism is a catch-all word whose brains don\u2019t function normally or have brain damage and vaccines do cause brain damage. The vaccine court has actually paid out a lot of compensation for brain damage when its medical term on the paperwork is encephalitis. But \u201cautism\u201d aside there are MANY side effects to vaccines. Just the ones that they say are common and \u201charmless\u201d are actually quite dangerous. For example, seizures are very common and very dangerous. As a Dr. in my family stated \u201ca seizure is never ok or normal\u201d. A seizure happens when there is \u201cABNORMAL brain activity\u201d. \nAnother common side affect that is clearly associated with vaccines is autoimmune disorders. Look up ASIA - autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants. And if you know anything about how vaccines work then you should understand how it creates autoimmunity. So allergies, diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto\u2019s), celiac, Lichen Sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, Guillian Barre Syndrome, Transverse Myelitis, etc... can all be caused by vaccines.  \n\nA great resource for info on aluminum in vaccines and autism:\nhttps://vaccinepapers.org\n\nImmune activation and autism \nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/772\n\nOne of the clearest disorders linked to vaccines is autoimmune diseases and encephalitis is a common side effect of vaccines.

It has been found that genetic and environmental factors are both involved in autism pathogenesis.\u201d\n\nScience evolves through observation and discovery. In 1958 the CDC claimed that cigarettes didn\u2019t cause cancer. In the absence of \u201cproof\u201d of safety or harm they default to \u201csafe\u201d and then experiment on the population at large \u201cwatching\u201d for additional side effects. Currently the CDC, who have many conflicts of interest say vaccines are safe and don\u2019t cause autism. We have to ask the questions and push for scientific progress like we did with tobacco and there is enough evidence so far to justify larger better safety studies. \n\nhttps://health.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/10214\nRising cost of autism \n\n\u201cEpidemic\u201d of autism \nhttps://safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/curent-dds-autism-cases.png\n\nWe are lacking in good true safety studies. There is no incentive to perform these studies though as any side effects found have to be listed on the package insert and could be added to the list of adverse reactions that could be compensated for in vaccine court. \n\u201cThe lack of evidence supporting vaccine safety is partially the result of the 1986 Act\u2019s unfortunate scheme which places the same agency, HHS, in charge of two conflicting duties. On the one hand, HHS is responsible for vaccine safety. On the other hand, HHS is simultaneously required to promote vaccine uptake and defend against any claim that vaccines cause any harm.\u201dhttp://icandecide.org/white-papers/VaccineSafety-Version-1.0-October-2-2017.pdf", "score": 1, "subreddit": "antivax"}

Ex ufc fighter and prominent gym owner nick catone is a great guy and had his son pass away recently. He blames it on a bad reaction to a vaccine because it happened in his sleep 8 days after getting one. I dont agree thats what caused it but i completely understand the need to blame something and the concern a bad reaction may have exacerbated a situation. This does not make vaccinating any less important obviously but frankie lives one town over and nick is a genuinely good guy. So a lot of people supporting him in this time got freaked out by vaccines themselves. Its super frustrating but nick also just lost his son so its kind of hard to expect him or those close to him to look at it from the greater good perspective. The amount of straight crazy anti vaxxers in the area adding fuel to the situation doesnt help either. But i couldnt tell you why this countys like that. At the end of the day the hardest thing with fighting anti vaxxers is that they genuinely dont understand the the science around what they hate, Even though its all clearly understood.

[One in New Zealand](https://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/06/06/3776327.htm) and [one in the US](https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/07/nightmarish-tale-tetanus-unvaccinated-child/). The parents in New Zealand changed their minds, now fully vaccinate their kids and speak out about vaccinations, but sadly the American parents are still anti vaxx and didn\u2019t even get the affected child the complete course to protect them against tetanus in the future. Unlike some other illnesses, you can get tetanus again. \n\nNot exactly what you were looking for, but it comes close. \n\nBut Steve Jobs of apple famously died of a very treatable cancer. If he\u2019d gotten treatment early it\u2019s 99% sure he would have survived. But he believed in juice and \u2018natural remedies\u2019 or some other stupid shit, and now he\u2019s dead.\nEdit: Apparently Steve Jobs\u2019 case wasn\u2019t as clear cut as I thought. Earlier treatment (he waited around 9 months choosing natural stuff instead) could possibly have helped him live longer, but maybe not. \nTetanus is absolutely preventable, even if you only get the vaccine soon after possible exposure. It is also fatal in 10-20% of cases, even with the best treatment.", "score": 18, "subreddit": "MurderedByWords"}

{"comment": "I will try to be as brief as possible.  \n\nBack when PCs were first on the market the dominant operating system was CP/M made by Gary Killdall, founder of Intergalactic Digital Research.  By the time IBM decided to get into the PC game with The Floridian Project Gary owned the PC operating system space that wasn\u2019t occupied by any of the other fledgling operating system makers back in the day.  Microsoft was alive and kicking its little toddler legs having moved from Albuquerque, NM where they were founded to write software for the MITS Altair, to Seattle.  Microsoft was writing applications and Gary Killdall was writing operating systems and that\u2019s how it was.  IBM, who wanted to license an operating system rather than develop their own for The Floridian Project, called on Microsoft because they were confused about one of Microsoft\u2019s products that shipped with an operating system.  Bill Gates agreed to meet with IBM and had to break the news that, while Microsoft would be happy to write as many applications as they wanted for their new PC, they would have to go talk to Gary about the OS because the product IBM was confused about had itself a licensed copy of CP/M.\n\nSo Bill called Gary and told him IBM was on the way.  The IBM entourage left Seattle for San Francisco and intended to meet with Gary and his wife in the IDM headquarters, a small Victorian home where IBM wasn\u2019t comfortable and neither were the Killdall\u2019s.  Gary said he would not sign IBM\u2019s non-disclosure so IBM left in a huff.  IBM called Microsoft back to say there would be no CP/M deal and that is when Steve Ballmer told IBM that \u201cwell, you know, we have an operating system it\u2019s not done yet and we would be happy to license the OS to you\u201d.  \n\nOnly one problem - Microsoft didn\u2019t have an operating system, not even one in development.    Across town they knew of a hobbyist who worked for a small computer store, named Seattle Computer Products, and this hobbyist, Tim Patterson, had written a clone of CP/M that Patterson named \u201cQuick and Dirty Operating System\u201d, or QDOS.  The only difference between CP/M and QDOS was when you booted off the floppy disk CP/M\u2019s prompt was C:&gt;\\ (which is why the \u201cC\u201d is still there - for CPM) and QDOS booted from floppy to \u201cA:&gt;\\\u201d.  Gates and Ballmer rushed over to the computer store with an offer to buy the intellectual property for QDOS, along with Tim Patterson\u2019s employ, for $50,000.00 and the store, desperate for cash, took the deal.\n\nThink about that - Bill Gates and Co. became who they are because of a $50,000.00 deal for a cloned operating system written by a hobbiest working for a small local computer store.  We could all have been using Mr. Robot DOS in an alternate universe.  After some tweaking and renaming to \u201cDisk Operating System\u201d Microsoft owned the operating and much of application space on the IBM PC but competition in the appellation space was hot, very hot and the operating system space was about to get hit with a blast that shook it to its core.\n\nBecause of how easy it had been to clone CP/M into QDOS the stage was set to clone DOS into other versions of DOS that looked and felt almost exactly the same to the average user.  Eventually there was IBM DOS, Microsoft DOS (a/k/a PC DOS for a while), Novell DOS, even Digital was in the mix with Digital DOS but Microsoft and IBM were the big players and there were plenty of one-offs as well, each nearly identical to one another with some having features the others didn\u2019t that may have useful to some businesses, such as Token Ring and SNA support for mainframe clients, and that weird TCP/IP protocol that lasted as an OS application of its own seemingly forever.  i installed many a version fo TCP/IP onto Windows 3.1 machines back in the day.  \n\nAround this time windowing systems on the PC were in their infancy and still required an underlying DOS to handle the OS chores and all versions of DOS at the time were single threaded.  That means when your word processor was printing that was all it did - print.  There was no \u201crunning the print job in the background\u201d or editing a Lotus 123 spreadsheet while DisplayWrite documented printed.  And don\u2019t get me started on the nightmare that was driver management in the pre-windows world but don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table but that's a story for another time.  Your Lotus 123 DOS application had its own printer drivers as did any other application that wanted a driver for some piece of hardware and it sucked managing all that.  In fact the Windows \u201cProgram Manager\u201d was so named because Window would operate at a layer between DOS and the applications the user interacted with and thus you could have one single driver for your printer that every application could use.  Brilliant!  Really.  That was brilliant.  IBM had all this on the radar and also had a good bead on multitasking having been in the mainframe game for decades so they were very well placed to take control of the PC OS world if they could catch a break from Microsoft.  And that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Microsoft gambled and released a version of DOS with lightweight multitasking built in called DOS 4.0x and it was buggy as hell.  Microsoft, unbeknownst to them, had flown too close to the sun and burned their delicate wings of wax and were soon spiraling towards Earth at terminal velocity.\n\nThe market responded by the abomination that was Microsoft\u2019s DOS by backpedaling to IBM DOS.  IBM, after all, was trusted and nobody got fired for choosing IBM.  That little upstart in Washington State?  Pssh\u2026. they could do applications, yes, but operating systems?  That\u2019s too important - leave that to IBM.  Apple Computer and Steve Jobs had seen this eventuality coming out of the DOS market.  Apple had a hunch IBM was going to win and with it any joy of computing would go too in favor or pressed shirts, ties, and polished shoes which is where the Apple 1984 video got its theme.\n\nIBM, around this time, had been working on a plan to create a new proprietary version of the PC with IBM only hardware and vastly suburb operating systems called OS/2.  OS/2 had multitasking, and my god, it was awesome. Working with OS/2 for the first time you could see what a computer was cable of doing.  You had no idea it was ever capable of this because you had never seen it and how can you imagine something you had never seen before?  Microsoft had, I think, Windows 2.0 out at the time (still requiring someone\u2019s underlying DOS to run - this would go on until the launch of Widows95 when the DOS and Windows software was married to a single, horrible thing).  EDIT: I forgot to mention - OS/2 was named \"Operating System 2\" and it ran on the IBM proprietary PS/2 computer, or Personal System 2, the last vestige of which USB killed once the PS/2 keyboard connector finally went the way of the dinosaur.\n\nAnd thus, in the land of OS/2 and Windows 2.x the DOS wars had begun and Microsoft damn near handed the keys to the operation computing world back to IBM on a silver platter.  Microsoft, realizing just how badly they screwed up, discontinued their relationship with IBM officially and dropped out of co-developing OS/2 with IBM - after all IBM learned from its first mistake by not retaining rights to the OS and there was no way in hell they were going to let anyone have a part of the OS/2 license world.  Microsoft had been using their application profits and development profits to build a better version of DOS and they screwed it up - fantastically.  This was probably the last time MIcrosoft scrambled in real fear of the future, perhaps outside the antitrust lawsuits that nearly split the company in two but those were interesting days indeed.\n\nBut that is how the DOS wars started.  Fun story - even today Microsoft\u2019s multiprocessing guts, first seen in Windows NT, in fact that was the first non-DOS OS from Microsoft, can still be traced back to old VAX operating system from Digital Equipment Corporation though their poaching of Dave Cutler from D.E.C to Microsoft.  Dave still works at Microsoft last I heard.  I think Tim Patterson retired not all that long ago.", "score": 2, "subreddit": "linux"}

Zinnia 'straight men should be forced to date transwomen' Jones.\n\nThat paper was written by J Temple Newhook, who actually misled in that paper about desisters so egregiously that Steensma pointed it out in a published response. \n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2018.1468292\n\n*The first comprehensive and inclusive summary of historical follow-up studies on the psychosexual outcome in gender variant children was provided by Zucker and Bradley (1995). Later, these numbers were updated in Steensma et al. (2011) and updated again and further discussed in Ristori and Steensma (2016). Important to mention here is that in the calculation of the overall persistence rate in the literature the two studies by Steensma et al. (2011, 2013) were never used. Including the two Steensma et al. studies in the discussion about persistence rates by the authors (particularly in Table 1 in Temple Newhook et al. 2018) is in our view an odd choice and a methodologically incorrect one*\n\n*but the suggested reasons why non-responders may actually be persisters are unlikely and farfetched. For instance, the authors suggested that children were lost at follow-up because they moved out of the country, were being treated elsewhere in the Netherlands, or institutionalized. The chance that one of these situations occurred is, however, very low. The few families that had to go abroad for some time usually stayed in touch with the clinic, because in those days there were hardly any gender identity clinics for children and it was extremely difficult to get a prescription of puberty-blocking hormones. Besides language barriers and insurance problems, this would have been a major reason why going to clinics abroad out of dissatisfaction with the Dutch clinic would have been hard. Going to another Dutch clinic was not an option either. For a few years there was only one other child and adolescent clinic (which is now closed), but entrance to both clinics was centralized. So, if a child would reapply for treatment in adolescence in either one of the clinics, they would be recognized as a previously known child. Although it was not a favorable situation, there were\u2014until fairly recently\u2014few places families could go to if they wanted to avoid having contact with our clinic. If children were institutionalized and still wanted transgender care we usually collaborated with these institutions to see what could be done in terms of their medical treatment.*\n\nThis paper was written by an actual scientist who studies this field (Steensma).\n\nZucker also wrote a rather thorough criticism of it.\n\n\nhttp://www.hbrs.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-myth-of-persistence-0ZUCKER.IJT_.2018.pdf\n\n*In Wallien and Cohen-Kettenis, the persistence rate for birth-assigned males was 20.3% and for birth-assigned females was 50.0%. In Steensma et al., the corresponding percentages were 29.1% and 50.0%, respectively.Singh (2012), who used a methodology very similar to Drummond, Bradley, Peterson-Badali, and Zucker(2008), found a persistence rate of 12.2%. Green\u2019s(1987) study, which is arguably the most important of the\u201cearlier\u201dfollow-up studies, found a persistence rate of 2.2%*\n\n*Temple Newhook et al. stated that\u201cEvidence of the actual distress of gender dysphoria...was dropped as a requirement for [Gender Identity Disorder] in the DSM-IV...\u201dThis is wrong.

No shade to Beau or Marisha here, since Beau is one of my favourites, but it reminded me a little bit of my least favourite thing that Percy, one of my other favourite characters, did (Spoilers All of C1 &gt;!when he considered selling his soul to a demon to get Vax back at the end!&lt; ). As a move that didn't work, it was a great indication of how much Beau cares about the party. If it did go through, though, I think it would have taken a lot of Nott's agency away. Nott already has some complicated feelings about the transformation - it's something she wants, but it's something that is already bittersweet for her. Adding onto that that Beau literally doomed herself to eternal misery to let the transformation go through would have just made those feelings more complicated, since now there would be a massive burden of survivor's guilt involved. Nott is very self-sacrificing when her friends are involved, and she cares about Beau a lot. Beau going through with the deal would be signing Nott up for something she would never have wanted. \n\nI think it would be way worse for Nott in the long run to turn back but always know that the only reason she could turn back was that her friend was suffering for it.
