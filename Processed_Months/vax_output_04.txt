{"comment": "ZFS is a great file system all around and just has a list of features a mile long, like supporting compression, deduplication, RAID, read and write caching, compression, snapshots, etc.  But somehow they made it incredibly easy to use and extremely reliable.  It's amazing technology and included with the base FreeBSD distribution, which is why it is associated with FreeNAS.\n\nFreeNAS is built upon FreeBSD, but IMO offers little value to someone who already knows the OS or is willing to learn it.  Why learn FreeBSD?  Because if you know Unix you already know FreeBSD, more or less, because its just a well designed and well documented flavor of Unix.  And if you don't know Unix, well, it's not going away anytime soon, and FreeBSD is a good way to learn it.  The only reason not to learn FreeBSD IMO is if you're already invested in a Linux distro and 100% happy with it.\n\nFreeBSD (and Unix in general) scales up, so if you want to build a serious NAS with FreeBSD and enterprise grade hardware you absolutely can and there are lots of folks on /r/freenas or /r/datahoarder who do just that.  But it scales down too, so you can also build a NAS out of a Core 2 Duo and four 1.5TB hard drives or whatever.  Your NAS might not impress everyone in /r/buildapc, but personally I'm always more impressed with someone who does more with less.\n\nAs for mini-PCs, well they're too small, too underpowered, they become obsolete quickly, and just frankly pointless - I mean just setup another VM, right?  But the thing is very similar arguments were made about the first personal computers - I mean, what's the point of having an Apple II on your desk if there's a VAX down the hall?\n\nThere's just.a lot to be said for having a small, quiet, self-contained appliance type setup that is 100% under your control - it was true for personal computers and it's still true for mini-PCs.

Look up the ingredients on this website.\n\nhttps://vaccineingredients.net/vaccines/dtap-daptacel\n\nNow research the ingredients.  Let's look at the first two:\n1.  Aluminum Phosphate\n2.  Formaldehyde.\n\nMSDS for Aluminum phosphate\nhttps://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/0062.pdf\n\nMSDS for Formaldehyde\nhttps://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/0946.pdf\n\nRead both of these documents and tell me WITH A STRAIGHT FACE you would injest these chemicals.  The second is formaldehyde and is listed as CARCINOGENIC TO HUMANS.  Both list the proper ppe to wear when handling. \n\nAnd these are just the first two ingredients.\n\nConsider that Daptacel has 8 other toxic ingredients, and that Diptheria has 6 other vaccinations included, each with it's laundry list of toxic soup...\n\nThe antivax movement  becomes simple\n\nMY personal experience, every time I get the flu shot I get the flu, and am sick for a month.  I haven't taken a flu shot in over 8 years and haven't gotten the flu since.  \n\nI have two nephews that I saw personally their massive change of personalities after getting their first round of vaccines, they are both autistic.

This can result in a total clearance of a cart within seconds by either fear or death.  \n\n\nFor Defending the intel: 6.6/10  \nReason: While the build rate on this can ensure a hard protection once its outside of your intel because of the 30 scouts you popped it on, it does still allow you to protect it since you can force scouts to die within a milisecond.  \nAlso, heavier health classes will have to run away since of than Invulv you have  \n\n\nFor Comp play: 8.65?/10  \nReason 1: Invulv allows a player to defend a chokepoint easily for 8 seconds, not allowing the enemy team to pass. This helps incredibly since a soldier or heavy with invulv is a instant \"BEGONE THOT\"  \nReason 2: Mini Crits and Crits are GODLY in comp, mainly cause of no random crits. Allowing for a boost of damage will result in a easy push foward as long as you don't get killed.   \n\n\nMain Reason: With the ability to easily push foward with no way of being pushed back (with the exception of pyros), this will result in a easy team push foward or a wipe of the enemy team  \n\n\nFor Casual Play: 7.5/10?  \nReason: Same reason as Comp play but now you have random crits and snipers that hack 24/7 so good luck building uber.  \n\n\nFor SpawnCamping: 8/10  \nReason: You are already doing well since you pushed the enemy team back to their spawn, but now you got mini crits and uber, Not even a vax heavy with the fist of steel can push out of spawn without dying!  \nBetter Reason: Vax counters the minicrits, Invulv counters vax. This results in the comp play reason. Area Denial with no way of being pushed back.  \n\n\nFor Memes: (7/10?)  \n\"here comes a engineer with widowmaker Better kil.. OH GOD HE HAS MINI CRITS AND INVULV. RUN BOIS, RUN!\" -Enemy Engineer  \n\n\nIn other words, I belive a mix of the quick fix stats and kritskrieg stats would be a better combo, like a balanced meal.  \n\n\nWith minicrits allowing for a easy push but not too easy  \nWith a weakened quickfix, allowing for a semi-fast heal.   \nThis can result in a mini protein shake, allowing your team to deal the damage it needs while also allowing for some fast heals.   \nThis will still result in it being semi op, maybe 7/10?  \n\n\nOr you could just go pure MiniCrits with a fast build rate, basically the quick fix equivalent of a kritskrieg.  \n\n\n  \nCurrent Stats:  \nHeal Rate:  \nIn Combat:  \nStock:24hp/s  \nUntitled Medi-gun: 26.4hp/s  \nOut of combat(Based on how recent you took dmg)  \nStock:   \nMin: 24hp/s  \nMax: 72hp/s  \nUntitled Medi-gun:  \nMin:26.4hp/s  \nMax:79.7hp/s  \nEffect Duration:  \nStock: 8s  \nUntitled Medi-gun: 8s  \nCharge Rate:   \nStock:  \nMax Build Rate: 2.5%/s (40s)  \nMin Build Rate: 1.25%/s (80s)  \nUntitled Medi-gun:  \nMax Build Rate: 2%/s (50s)  \nMin Build rate: 1%(100s)  \nOverheal:  \nStock: +50% of CURRENT MaxHP  \nScout Base: 125(185)  \nSoldier Base:200(300)  \nPyro Base: 175(260)  \nDemo-man Base: 175(260)  \nHeavy Base: 300 (450)  \nEngineer Base 125 (185)  \nMedic Base: 150 (225)  \nSniper Base: 125 (185)  \nSpy Base: 125 (185)  \nUntitled Medi-gun:  \nScout Base: 125(155?)  \nSoldier Base:200(250)  \nPyro Base: 175(217.5?\\[215\\])  \nDemo-man Base: 175(217.5?\\[215\\])  \nHeavy Base: 300 (375)  \nEngineer Base 125 (155?)  \nMedic Base: 150 (187.5?\\[185\\])  \nSniper Base: 125 (155?)  \nSpy Base: 125 (155?)  \nOverheal Rate:  \nStock: No Known Impedement  \nUntitled Medi-gun:  \nIn Combat: 13.2hp/s  \nOut of Combat  \nMin:13.2hp/s  \nMax:36hp/s\n\n  \nThis took me 30m-1h, Read it, no TL:DR for you.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TF2WeaponIdeas"}

This is because your phone adjusts its own transmit power to suit the path loss to the tower, so by having a tower reasonably close your phone can use much lower power levels. Since power density is an inverse square law thing (at least in the far field) most of your exposure is from the handset not the tower, so having the handset run at lower power lowers your net exposure. \n\nThe problem with this sort of thing is that the best anyone can ever honestly say is something along the lines of \"We have found no evidence (p &lt; 0.05) of cancers/reproductive harm/whatever from RF exposure in band .... at power levels up to ...\", where as what people want is \"5G does not cause cancer (or whatever is disease of the day)\", very difficult to prove a negative.\n\nNote that that p &lt; 0.05 threshold for statistical significance means you can expect to get it wrong 1 time in 20 at that level, so if you are looking for a small signal in a lot of noise you can expect a false positive 1 time in 20 even if there is nothing there. This is why individual studies are of limited value, you need LOTS of independent studies, then you filter out the ones with bad methodology (There will be plenty)), then you look to see if there is anything on aggregate there.\n\nEven if you discover something you then need to figure out the mechanism, there was a famous case of a cluster of unusual cancers near a newly built 100kV power line.\n\nMaybe power lines cause cancer? Well, the study was looked at hard, and found to be good data with appropriate statistical methodology (Not always a given), but it just seemed very unlikely that power frequency fields would do that, so time for some more investigation.... \n\nEventually it was discovered that the company who had been hired to keep the plant life down along the right of way were using some VERY dodgy herbicides that really should not have been employed.

It identifies there is a threat and then creates specific antibodies to combat the threat.  This does not stop the virus from getting back into your system after that.  All it allows is for your immune system to recognize the virus right away and to send the appropriate antibodies immediately to stop the virus from spreading to the point where you start to feel symptoms from it.  However, your immune system can still fuck it up, or it can be suppressed for various reasons.  That is why no vaccine will ever say they are 100% effective.

It is not unreasonable to anticipate that once we do produce a vaccine, we will have a similar removal drive and mass produce and supply them globally. Like polio, I think anyone who tried to profiteer off this vaccine would be in for a world of push back.  \n\n\n4) My Morning ramble - This disease effects the worst possible group it could effect.

If AIDS effected rich white men the way if effects poor black ones your damn right we would have cured it a while ago.  \n\n\nSure, this is changing because of the growth of the Asian powerhouse economies.

Just look at the reactions of the rich white men (the US and Europe business elite) - publicly telling people it'll be fine, telling employees to go to work, while they take things very seriously behind the scenes and make damn well to isolate themselves in their hideaway bunkers.

{"comment": "My personal opinion on this is that 5G is bad, but not for the reasons people think. The new laws being proposed to \u201chelp it\u201d increase the surveillance state. But does it give you cancer? That\u2019s equivalent to taking the transformer out of a microwave, turning the power down by 10 times and mounting it at the top of a tower and saying it gives you cancer lol\n\nOne thing to take note, is that microwave transformers use the 2.4 ghz frequency or \u201cWiFi band\u201d to heat stuff up INSIDE of a semi sealed container and that your phone cannot use more than 23dbm of power on anything wireless which translates to 600mw which even less than 1000 times less power than a microwave.\n\nContinuing with 5G...\nIt can barely even go through skin when you turn your back around (mmWave) and the low band is equivalent to the same LTE frequency we already have today. Just so we remember, higher frequency = less range using same transmit power as we can observe with low band vs mmWave. And I\u2019ll just say this, where are the people who are screaming about real radio towers? Those things transmit at the same power of a microwave transformer or more lol\n\nWith that being said, I don\u2019t think that any technology using Software Defined Radios can potentially give you cancer because most of them use very low power at the top of a mast or \u201ctower\u201d and the user equipment does even less because the internal antenna has low gain (which is the whole reason WiFi doesn\u2019t reach anywhere without a powerful antenna).\nBut I do think that it\u2019s being used to ramp up the surveillance state via text messaging records/receipts, surveillance that \u201ccracks down\u201d on underage content online, and through the commercialization by corporations (our biggest enemy) of our location data on a more accurate level because 5G has good coverage in combination because of its added microcells (pole sites) and macro cells (mast/tower sites).\n\nBut as the author of the post has said, the people saying it has \u201ccaused cancer\u201d using kids as an example is both hilarious because (those were the same people that scolded others for using climate change child activists instead of expressing their real intentions that they really didn\u2019t believe in climate change) but also they use it as a mesh to distract from the fact that America has a clean drinking water problem or regulations that protect from toxic stuff being in our foods. \n\nBut making a last point, I think that the people blaming 5G for health problems are either grifting or being used to blame that for health problems caused by being anti vax (which I understand the concern of what evil can happen using vaccines but it\u2019s a scare tactic used like people against Coronavirus which is real, but we all know some of the bad faith actors trying to \u201chelp\u201d fund research for a vaccine or such) or by self centrism projected through individualism in politics to scapegoat the notion that people own the government which is why we currently see the government the way it is today. \n\nBut the biggest question is (since I\u2019m not that old but I know older people are the ones that see this reddit), I thought yall were smart enough to know the tactics by now that they use to push fear into people? Like did people forget that \u201cthey\u201d can also co opt your \u201ctruth seeking\u201d by pushing disinformation as the truth seekers you see around on YouTube or wherever talking about the \u201ctruth\u201d?

For decades, we mandated that children get three to four vaccines during infancy and toddlerhood to protect against diseases that are legitimate threats. Since the mid-2000s, that number has shot up to be closer to forty in some states. Many of these new vaccines have been proven unnecessary and have the potential for harmful side effects. The immunization schedule is being indiscriminately inflated by for-profit pharmaceutical companies seeking to mandate purchase of their products. There are a lot of doctors who speak out against this.

Vaccines do have side effects and if your kids don't get them they both get the benefits of not risking side effects and living in a world of herd immunity where they'll never encounter Polio. \n\nNow if everyone did it there's no herd immunity and Polio is obviously going to become a problem.\n\nBuy local logic: Buying local keeps money here and supports local business.\n\nAlso fully true but instead of living in a world of herd immunity you are living in a world of global trade. If just a few people buy local it won't matter at all but if everyone does that guarantees that the price of everything will go up while the quality, availability, and selection will go down.\n\nAs I mentioned in this thread I'm living down under and when I visit Costco I end up buying things made or grown in Canada. Local equivalents exist they just cost more. So if we all bought local all those Canadian's making and growing those things would lose their jobs meanwhile we'd all be spending more on local equivalents.\n\nTrade with the largest possible group makes everyone better off. Or just redefine local as Earth and you are good to go.\n\nHowever, where people get upset with this is where they think I'm anti local. I'm not. When I'm home in BC I buy beer from BC.

What would I be afraid of exactly?\n\n\n\n &gt;Humans dont need a \u201cmicrochip\u201d to be tracked and controlled. We have smartphones and face recognition\n\nNot everyone has a cell phone (or you can just throw it away/put it down/leave it at home), and can you imagine the amount of computing power necessary to run face recognition software constantly on all surveillance cameras globally? Unfathomable. Not to mention adding surveillance cameras everywhere they don't already exist - impossible.\n\nMuch cheaper and easier to have a QD biomarker that you're required to scan when entering any public venue - be it transportation, grocery store, school, etc. The blockchain data management framework that would be required to handle it has already been developed by MIT (see OPAL model), and is in use by ID2020, the effort to give every human on the planet a digital ID and centralized cryptocurrency wallet to replace cash (also being tested in a 3rd world country).\n\n&gt;And no, it wouldnt be easier to use this method of vaxx history because the dye fades after about 5 years.\n\nWho cares if it fades in 5 years if you're required to get vaccination boosters every 6 mos, 1, 2, 3, 4 years? The dye could easily be reapplied/added to durning those manditory boosters. And while I have complete faith is science that they'll develop a dye that doesn't fade it 5 years, I don't believe for a second that if there were other bionanotech mechanisms involved, that they would tell us.\n\n&gt;Its not practical for societies with functioning medical record systems.\n\nIt's probably the most practical way imaginable; and remember, this is not just about managing medical records, or simply vaccination records, it could be used in conjunction with Gates' ID2020, which has massive implications on the future of the global financial system. One world digital currency.

I also got really unwell last year which meant we had months &amp; months of a shit plastered hall that drove me crazy, remember sometimes life (and covid) just happens and try not to become obsessed with finishing it. Every little step is a step closer to what you want. Also I've found remembering that making a home a proper, proper home takes years? You can't just move in and fill it with lovely furniture &amp; memories &amp; nick nacks instantly, that takes life to live and things to bring back in etc etc? So see doing up the house as part of that journey too.\n\nBut short term - I'd recommend making at least one or two rooms your safe havens where you can come back from work and not be driven crazy by the state of the house. So maybe your bedroom first &amp; one bathroom? Or your bedroom &amp; another you use as a makeshift living room? Then expand outwards. \n\nGood luck and make sure you're being gentle on yourselves &amp; taking regular breaks. Same as above, maybe prioritise 2 clean rooms and shut the rest of the doors on it and just break it up into manageable chunks. You've got lots of time &amp; more energy (a pure luxury!) thanks to covid which is nice.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "UKPersonalFinance"}

{"comment": "Submission Statement  \\[The Math\\]\n\nThe image is the influenza data released by the CDC for 2019/2020.  They have an estimate of the total number of those who get infected with the flu at 39,000,000 \u2013 56,000,000 and total deaths at 24,000 \u2013 62,000.\n\nUsing the highest infection and death total we get 62,000 / 56,000,000 \\* 100 = **0.11%** Infection Fatality Rate.  Or if we choose the low estimate of infections that would be 62,000 / 39,000,000 \\* 100 = **0.16%**\n\nOn the other hand COVID-19 data used in the media is NOT currently using the Infection Fatality Rate but the Case Fatality Rate. That means only those cases which are confirmed are counted, and that skews the number towards those who die.  **So when Dr Fauci and Dr Ferguson predict massive amounts of death they are using the scarier and almost certainly incorrect Case Fatality Rate**.  Fauci himself admitted this discrepency between IFR and CFR in his paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2020 [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387).\n\nCurrent death tolls for the USA COVID cases are as follows (and there is much that can be said about how many deaths can be misattributed to CV)\n\nConfirmed Cases 558,581, and deaths at 21,964.  So we'll take these numbers at face value for now, and to calculate the Infection Fatality Rate we will use estimates which some mainstream pro vax doctors have put forward, 5 million total infected.  That yields 21,964 / 5,000,000 \\* 100 = **0.43%**\n\nLet's say those estimates are wrong, and in fact the infection rate is already 15 million, that means we have  21,964 / 15,000,000 \\* 100 = **0.14%**.  The total infected could be even higher than that, but we don't know.\n\nThese two estimates fall within the range found by the most recent German study which yielded a fatality rate of **0.37%** (though a small study it is getting closer to the truth). [https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theblaze.com/news/german-study-shows-coronavirus-mortality-rate-five-times-lower-than-widely-reported-numbers](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.theblaze.com/news/german-study-shows-coronavirus-mortality-rate-five-times-lower-than-widely-reported-numbers)\n\nIt should be noted that fatality rate numbers drop well below 0.1% for people under the age of 50.\n\nNow that we have this better data, as a nation we can change our policies based on calm reason instead of the \"it's going to kill millions\" panic we entered into this situation with.  COVID-19 couldn't possibly kill a million Americans let alone two.  It is even doubtful it could reach 100,000 as we enter into spring when vitamin D levels naturally increase and coronavirus's usual season (Janurary to April) is ending.\n\nHigh vitamin D areas such as the nations of SE Asia have barely experienced any COVID-19 deaths while they also have the most lax policies and closest proximity to China of almost any other countries.\n\nThis all points to the need for a less severe policy to contain the virus.  The benefits we gain is not worth the cost of the so-called solution.  We are already seeing massive job loss, businesses shutting down and millions unable to even pay rent or mortgages with a possible increase in homeless families on the horizon.

I learned BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, Pascal, and SQL. Plus learned some on my own time like 6502. But I didn\u2019t have an assembler. I had to hand code the numeric instructions. I still remember some of those like $AD for load accumulator from the following memory address.

But as graduation neared they were open to college thinking our careers needed it. At the time the society wasn\u2019t banning college.  They were discouraging it in favor of pioneering but left is as something to think about. Our family thought about it and chose college.\n\nThe society was using computers too.

{"comment": "Ask your doc about seborrheic dermatitis. I thought I had rosacea for the longest time until I found out about seb derm.  I also developed overnight (10 years ago) out of nowhere. And be careful with antibiotics. I almost hesitate to say anything about them because being anti-antibiotic sounds almost like anti-vaxx or something. I'm pro medicine and pro vaxx of course but taking antibiotics for long periods of time, like longer than a week, can have negative effects. I was prescribed antibiotics for acne when I was younger and took them for years without a thought. And that, in all likelihood, is what caused my seb derm.\n\nYou'll want to get 2% Ketoconazole shampoo script from your doc. 1% is OTC and is useless. 2% will  slough away the redness if you use it daily for about a week. But, like antibiotic, you can only use it for short periods. So, use the shampoo to take away the bulk of the redness, then you can do maintenance with natural methods including solution of apple cider vinegar or coconut oil. \n\nThe answer for long term relief is to change your diet. Most likely, this problem, whether it's rosacea or seb derm, was caused by years of poor diet and maybe antibiotic. So try to stop eating bread and then dairy and see if you see any improvement. You know how it seems like everyone is gluten sensitive and lactose intolerant these days. It's not a coincidence.

{"comment": "Like I said in a previous post social Darwinism has a giant hole in the middle of it that debunks it. The fittest isn't defined. Communist China and Cuba etc. survives. Communist China and Cuba etc will continue to survive so it is just as fit as as all of the capatilist and Democratic systems on earth. That's the problem with social Darwinism defining what counts as the \"fittest\" is entirely up to your own definition and will be heavily influenced by your culture , upbringing, political leanings etc. A quote from the Wikipedia article.\n\n\"Part of the difficulty in establishing sensible and consistent usage is that commitment to the biology of natural selection and to 'survival of the fittest' entailed nothing uniform either for sociological method or for political doctrine. A 'social Darwinist' could just as well be a defender of laissez-faire as a defender of state socialism, just as much an imperialist as a domestic eugenist.\"\n \nAnother quote\n\"Peter Kropotkin argued in his 1902 book Mutual Aid : A factor of Evolution that Darwin did not define the fittest as the strongest, or most clever, but recognized that the fittest could be those who cooperated with each other. In many animal societies, \"struggle is replaced by co-operation\".\n\nSocial Darwinism is built at base level on a faulty permis that the \"fittest\" will be the same across the whole world. When if you look at Darwin's work the \"fittest\" is often localized to the circumstances the produce them. So while capitalism has definitely become the \"fittest\"  it is not a defense of social Darwinism because other systems that continue survive are just as fit. As long as those systems exist they are \"fit\" until the collapse or get overthrown.  The most fit by Darwin was those that have the tools to pass on their genes that's it if I work communally to do that I'm just as fit and the individual and this can be seen in humans with highly communal cultures and highly individualistic cultures have similar levels of achievement.  They are both fit cultures.\n\n\n\n\"In the arena of economics, Social Darwinists believed that the fit should rise and the unfit should fail. You can't prove or disprove the concept that the fit should rise and the unfit should fail. That's an opinion. In the same way, you can't prove or disprove that chocolate is delicious and spinach is gross. Personal preferences are not scientific theories that you can objectively say are incorrect. \"\n\nThis is where you are misunderstanding what a theory is.A theory is \u00a0supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something. Social Darwinism attempted to explain human success and failure it did so using faulty evidence. The evidence was originally believed and then disproven. That doesn't make it an opinion it's a discredited theory it was once widely accepted and informed a large number of decisions in Governments like the UK,  Nazi Germany, France , the USA. And when people realized the theory was wrong they widely discontinued the practices it promoted. You \"opinion\" on social Darwinism can still be built upon a discredited theory. The anti vax crowd is a group of people who believe a discredited theory based on faulty evidence. That's their opinion", "score": 1, "subreddit": "changemyview"}

It\u2019s not a coincidence every health and dietetics organization recommends limiting meat and states fat intake and eating predominantly if not exclusively plants. Chris Kresser is a charlatan, he is an anti vax acupuncturist with a degree in ancient Chinese Medicine \n\nNo, sugar is not the enemy. It\u2019s not a health food but it\u2019s relatively harmless. If you aren\u2019t overweight, are active, and eating a nutrient dense diet you can eat a fat amount of sugar without ill effects\n\n\n\u201c The main issue with *added* sugar is it\u2019s not nutrient dense and can displace more nutrient dense foods. Though the exact same could be said for added oil which is even less satiating ^1 .\n\nSome people say sugar is bad because it spikes your blood sugar but by that logic, sweet potatoes, potatoes, yams, oatmeal, rice, cous cous, popcorn, and pasta are all less healthy than sugar since they have higher GIs/GLs than Coca Cola ^2 .Glycemic index isn\u2019t irrelevant but it\u2019s only one factor\n\nOne could argue that postprandial glycemic spikes are inherently harmful but the only alternative for energy is fat which causes postprandial spikes in free fatty acids and triglycerides ^3 \n\n I haven\u2019t seen a study compared the harmfulness of postprandial glycemic spikes to postprandial triglyceride and free fatty acid spikes but both are independently associated with heart disease and mortality. I might put my money on the latter being worse since postprandial lipemia lasts 6-8 hours and postprandial glycemic only lasts 2 hours. It\u2019s harder to study postprandial lipemia since it lasts 6-8 hours so we see less research on it\n\nFurthermore exercise attenuates the effects of sugar consumption much better than the effects of dietary fat. Exercise lowers glucose ^4 and triglyceride levels but doesn\u2019t lower cholesterol levels much or consistently ^5 \n\nOther methods, like a carbohydrate last meal pattern, almond appetizer, hand heating, etc.  have been shown to attenuate the glycemic response as well ^6 , not sure if they exist for the lipemic response. \n\n\n\n\n\n1) \u201cThree separate experiments in lean subjects confirmed that a 1.52-MJ (362-kcal) carbohydrate supplement at breakfast suppressed appetite 90 min later but had no effect on a test meal given after 270 min. A 1.52-MJ (362-kcal) fat supplement produced no detectable action on measures of appetite at any time point. Therefore, fat and carbohydrate do not have identical effects on the appetite profile. In a further study in obese subjects, a novel experimental design was used to assess the satiating efficiency and compensatory response of fat. Eating from a range of either high-fat or high-carbohydrate foods, obese subjects voluntarily consumed twice as much energy from the fat items, thereby indicating a weak action of fat on satiation. In turn, this large intake of fat exerted a disproportionately weak effect on satiety. These studies suggest that the appetite-control system may have only weak inhibitory mechanisms to prevent the passive overconsumption of dietary fat. The results indicate how this action could induce a positive energy balance and lead to a gradual upward drift in body mass index.\u201d https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8475895/\n\n2) https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods\n\nhttps://extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/documents/1/glycemicindex.pdf\n\n3) https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/141/4/574/4630590\n\n4) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610683/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6243616/\n\n\n\n5) https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa020194?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\n6) Glycemic blunting strategies include [premeal vinegar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16015276/), [having certain appetizers like almonds](http://www.cytothesis.us/3.0/Almond_Glucose-Tolerance.pdf), [carbohydrate last meal order](https://drc.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000440), [postprandial exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6243616/), [adding fiber](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1852093), [hand heating](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229919316279), and [adequate sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526115/) though I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more\u201d", "score": 2, "subreddit": "ScientificNutrition"}

You have Bill trying to push his Vax propaganda even though we have two anti malaria drugs that seem to btfo the virus, that is another discussion in itself. We had the dems trying to take advantage of this and pork the stimulus bill and even talked about passing a mail to vote bill. \n\nThis is what i think the real motive was and it involves china and dems/ds working together. China was getting btfo, Joe Biden panders to china and china wants joe as president as they know Joe will let them get back to pre 2017 days and cancel the trade deal. Dems will stop at nothing to regain power. \n\nOkay, follow me. China releases the virus, dems use this crises and try to pork the stimulus bill (obviously) but the main goal is to pass a Mail to Vote bill. Hoping the quarantine will drag out, the media scaring the public long enough to stay indoors so they would mail in their votes. Obviously this opens the door to massive voting fraud and if history is any indication, they will steal the election.

Started with a paint scheme and built my lore from there. Had a lot of fun finding established details in the current 40k lore (like Kaedes Nex and the Massacre at Isstvan V) and extrapolating from there! Here\u2019s some pics of the army at LVO: https://imgur.com/gallery/m1ac4jC\nAnd they\u2019ve also been featured in a Kill Team battle report at my buddies channel, Odds of War: https://youtu.be/JltwXnQ0P3k \n\nRaven Guard: 11th Company \u201cAsh Ravens\u201d\n\nCompany Commander: Kaedes Vax\n\u201cMaster of The Hunt\u201d\n\u201cSuccessor of Moritat Prime, Kaedes Nex\u201d\n- When the Raven Guard came to Isstvan V, Kaedes Nex fought tenaciously alongside his battle-brothers. After the betrayal by the now traitor legions, he vanished into the wastes to stalk traitors on his own terms while the remnants of the Raven Guard escaped with Primarch Corax from the planet. Kaedes valued vengeance over escaping with the remnants of the Chapter and gathered up any remaining battle-brothers on the battlefield who felt the same. For this, he was driven to regain his honor by bringing death to any and all traitors in the galaxy and prove his personal mission to be a valid one. The battle-brothers who remained to fight alongside him were driven by this same goal and the 11th Company, the Ash Ravens, was born. \n- First among those battle-brothers to join Nex in his cause was a marine named Vax. His loyalty and prowess as marksman earned him the position of second in command to Kaedes Nex as Shadow Captain of the 11th Company. \n- Upon his death in the early M40, Commander Kaedes Nex passed on his company to his loyal captain, Vax, in the hopes that Vax could finish his legacy and finally restore honor to their company. Vax adopted his Commander\u2019s name \u201cKaedes\u201d in his honor and adorned his helmet\u2019s faceplate with the bone ashes of Nex himself, thus starting the armor tradition that the Ash Ravens wear to this very day. \n- Kaedes Vax has since been charged with completing Nex\u2019s goal of leading the Ash Ravens to hunt down all the remaining traitor legions and exact righteous vengeance upon them for the Massacre on Isstvan V. \n\nShadow Captain: Vrynn Karas\n- \u201cBearer of the Hunter\u2019s Tools: the Korvidari Bolts\u201d\n- Second in command to Company Master Kaedes Vax, Captain Karas has proven himself a worthy tactician and marksman. Granted the relic Korvidari Bolts gifted by Shrike himself, Karas is known for his supreme patience in lining up the perfect shot or capitalizing on closing unsuspected traps across the battlefield. \n\nLibrarian: Umbrant\n- \u201cSpeaker for the Umbral Void\u201d\n- A particularly reclusive and quiet member of the 11th Company, Librarian Umbrant is known for his prowess over the shadows themselves. Be it weaving ethereal shadows to shroud allies from harm or to sow discord and fear among enemies at the front lines, Librarian Umbrant is a master of obfuscation and an invaluable asset to the Ash Ravens. \n\nLieutenant: Kiavos\n- \u201cBearer of the Great Relic: Ex Tenebris\u201d\n- Captain Karas\u2019 right hand man. On the battlefield, Lt. Kiavos is typically found orchestrating the various traps and subterfuge that the forward scouts of the 11th company are setting up behind enemy lines. He was granted the second relic gifted to the 11th Company by Shrike:  the masterwork bolter, Ex Tenebris. \n\nDreadnought Ancient: Corvidae\n- Now housed in a Raven Guard Pattern Relic Contemptor Dreadnought, Corvidae was one of the few marines to ignore Kaedes Nex\u2019s dishonorable past on Kiavahr and admire his tenacity on the battlefield. He fought alongside Nex on Isstvan V and has remained loyal to the Ash Ravens ever since that fateful day. He is a repository of knowledge honored by the rest of his company and is held in the utmost regard as a fellow battle-brother of their former leader, Kaedes Nex. It is said that Corvidae is one of the last ancients still alive who holds a burning memory of all of the names and faces of the traitors he encountered on Isstvan V. As such, Battle-brothers of the 11th Company go to great lengths to protect Corvidae as a way to preserve his memories and their righteous mission. \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \n\n11th Company, The \u201cAsh Ravens\u201d Lore: \n\n- The Ash Ravens of the 11th Company are a vigilante battle-force of the Raven Guard that have been stricken from the records in the Ravenspire ever since Kaedes Nex separated from the Raven Guard forces at Isstvan V to pursue his own vengeance. Chapter Master, Kayvaan Shrike, is the only level of oversight still remaining on the 11th company within the Raven Guard. Recognizing the pardon that Corvus Corax gave to Kaedes Nex before the Horus Heresy to fight alongside him, Shrike holds himself responsible for giving Nex\u2019s legacy in the Ash Ravens an opportunity to redeem themselves via their merciless hunt for vengeance against the traitor legions. It is Shrike\u2019s hope that this ragtag band of hunters can continue to work behind the shadows and strike fear into the heart of the traitor legions as is the way of the Trifold Path that Primarch Corax taught them. \n- Left to their own devices in the galaxy and knowingly operating without backup from the rest of their chapter, the Ash Ravens focus on stealth, subterfuge, and assassination operations as a means to minimize overall casualties on the battlefield. Their troops and front lines specialize in infiltration and sabotage, while the rear bastion comprise of heavy artillery and expert marksmen to either pick off valuable figureheads or rain unsuspecting hell down upon an already bewildered foe. Finally, Company Master Kaedes Vax holds a speedy contingent of jump pack marines to quickly dive into the heart of that confusion, mow down any leadership hiding among the ruins, and secure vengeance and vindication for the company. \n- Since hearing of Haarken Worldclaimer\u2019s incursion upon Vigilus, the Ash Ravens have deployed into the Segmentum Obscurus in the hopes of hunting down the Black Legion and exacting vengeance upon the traitors for orchestrating the Massacre at Isstvan V and starting the Heresy so long ago. \n\n- Company Words: \u201cAnte mortem vindictae!\u201d (Vengeance before Death!)\n\n- Company Symbol: Being stricken from the records of the Ravenspire, the Ash Ravens have since removed most of their Raven Guard iconography from their armor. They feel unworthy of that insignia until they can reclaim their honor by hunting down all of the traitor legions. Only Company Master Kaedes bears the Raven Guard symbol upon his right shoulder, as a memory of their origin and as a symbol of hope for reclaiming that lost honor from so long ago. \n\n- Company Colors: Drab Green with Black and Bone colored accents. Their helmets bear the bone colored markings on the faceplate known as \u201cThe Grim Reminder\u201d. This marking symbolizes the company forever wearing the ashes of their fallen brothers into battle against their foes and allowing them to once again be the last face seen before the foe\u2019s certain demise. \n\n- Company Armaments: Thanks to the understanding of Chapter Master Shrike, the 11th Company has not been without upgrades seen in the Astartes since M41. Upgraded to Primaris and Phobos armor, the Ash Ravens have been granted a pass through the Rubicon Primaris and now have the means by which to operate under the radar of their foes in the Vigilus system as a Vanguard strike force. Additionally, Kaedes Vax was granted the new Phobos Pattern armor and a Shadowmaster jump pack akin to Shrike\u2019s own design so as to better spearhead his company into the heart of the enemy.", "score": 3, "subreddit": "BeerHammer"}

Children with leukemia. They are pumped full of drugs and that gives them a chance to survive their disease.

But when you investigate its not that at all but environmental factors which could be controlled with psych education, family therapy ect. Amazingly when the drugs do not work, they come back and for some shocking reason the family therapy or more environmental controlled approach works so much better. \n\nHere is an example 2 patients; (obviously iver exaggerated) \n\n1) life is in absolute turmoil, shit life, shit relationship, not achieving life goals, in a medial job which is not akin to their educational level. So showing signs of depression\n\n2) great life, great relationships, good life fulfilling job, highly educated to their intelligence level, hobbies and everything all good, all good. But still showing signs of depression \n\nThe problem here is that without investigating patient 1\u2019s environment, a doctor would be quick to prescribe antidepressants. Especially in the uk with GPs calling it a chemical imbalance when actually that patient needs more holistic approach. Calling it a chemical imbalance or a mental health issue in my opinion is putting a damaging label on someone which doesn\u2019t do them justice or treat them like a person. This is a discussion which needs to be had within the community, especially with older psychologists i have come across who will pathologies a person with a mental health issue, when in actual fact its other environmental factors. \n\nBut of a ramble but on my lunch break and i hope i have made sense with my thought vomit!!!\n\nEnjoy", "score": 43, "subreddit": "Neuropsychology"}

Animal bites on the job should be treated seriously. There are so many options to ensure the safety of employees (muzzle, drugs) and animal. Animals that bite are potentially going to need quarantine depending on vax status or worse if the bite is severe.\n\nMy first year out of school I got bites. It happens. I learned best with calm to somewhat squirmy dogs that would offer some resistance to restraint to familiarize myself with common reactions patients make when afraid or painful. I often would watch senior technicians and how they responded to really crazy pets and learned how they managed.\n\nKind of weird but I'm at the point now where I can usually tell how the animal is going to react just by being so close to them.

{"comment": "Thank you for taking the time to reply with a link to their research database. So far, I'm not very fond of the way that autism is being linked to almost everything. It's being linked to substances (vaccines), electromagnetic waves (5G) and change in air pressure (ultrasound), which clearly shows that there is a mix up between correlation and causation and a lack of an actual scientific understanding of them. It is very clear that the rise in autism cases is mainly due to the increasing understanding of the disorder by both psychologists and the public which results in more tests and thus more diagnoses being made and definitely not all of the bullshit about waves. It's almost as if they already made their conclusion before they tried to find the 'evidence' for it. As an autistic person, I should also say that autism comes in many flavours and that it's flat out discrimination to say that autistic people as a whole are 'worse' than neurotypical people, which is what the site really seems to push. Regardless of all of that, I'll still check some of the published and peer reviewed articles out tomorrow. The pay wall i encountered was on the following page:\nhttps://childrenshealthdefense.org/vaccinesafety/\n\nIt's not the propaganda that is wrong, as I am aware of the definition of the term, but it's rather the profit that they're making off of it which shows that there is a huge bias present that is more favorable to one side of the discussion. Personally I wouldn't say that animal rights activism is similar to the anti vax movement, as there is a lot of science that is mispresented in the latter movement while the veganism activism is based on actual science, statistics and ethical reasoning. Since the veganism movement, we have seen that people are eating less meat and animal products than they did years ago which has lead to relatively fewer animal deaths. Since the anti vax movement, we have seen a resurgence in the amount of measles cases with some of them resulting in deaths. \n  \nThe fact is that the scientifical evidence in support of vaccines far outweighs the evidence against it and that this antivax movement is just the same as many other anti scientific movements, like the climate change deniers, the flat earth society, the coronavirus deniers etc. There's blood on the hands of the anti vax movement, but who knows.

Unfortunately except for a few of the last vaxen made (smaller models) still kicking around doing manufacturing control stuff...they're all in a landfill or museum.  The Vax was one of the first general purpose computers fast enough to run real time applications, so it buried itself well in manufacturing processes.  Similarly IBM came out with their AS/400 'miniframe', a more recent and smaller machine that can run much of what the old mainframes could run code wise.\n\nAnd that day as another guy and I working on a datacenter around 1985 and installing a decsystem 10 (the 10 and d20 were Digitals 'sort of mainframes') and remarking \"imagine some day when all of this (pointing to 4 6' tall cabinets) will all fit in a box under your desk.\n\nI think a modern flagship phone has more power now than that decsystem 10 had...\n\nAnd VMS being one of the first virtual memory operating system causing so much more wasteful programming.

{"comment": "Good for you. It was the same for me I couldnt even think about it without panicing. My mother said I once bit a nurse and hid in the closet when she tried to give me a shot. When I grew too big and put up too much of a fight she sat down with me and asked me why I was so afraid and how she could help me. I couldnt answer her but she promissed me she wouldnt make me do anything but also stressed that one day I might not have a choice.\nI am still not 100% over the fear and cant say I did  anything special. It came down to the pure need for it. It was either me giving this one blood sample or keep suffering daily. My hands had started to hurt realy badly every morning and evening and I started to lose feeling in them. So I convinced myself it would be just this one time.\nA few months later I hurt my self in the garden and the doctor was realy angry when he learned I wasnt vaccinated. He thought I was anti vax no matter what I told him. Kind of drove the whole point home how stupid I was being.\nAnd thats pretty much what I did since. Think it would be just this one time and tell myself that I didnt want to be a crazy person. Plus telling healthcare workers that you have a problem with needles helps too.

{"comment": "Ok so lemme answer each of your hypothetical q\u2019s! Sorry in advance if this becomes an ESSAY.\n\nA lot of stuff is totally dealt with through your GP. Ie you go to the doctors saying you\u2019re having medium bad pains in your arms/wrists/hands when you game (for example). Your GP checks you out, says \u201clooks like carpal tunnel, try to do these exercises, stop gaming so much, and here\u2019s some wrist braces for when you sleep.\u201d\nLet\u2019s say you do that, but it gets worse. You back to your GP. They would at this point refer you to your local specialist, in a local hospital. If the things that doctor prescribes (physical therapy and/or meds) don\u2019t work, then you\u2019d be sent to a different specialist, possibly at a bigger hospital, one with more experience in harder to treat cases.\n\nIf on the other hand you go back to your GP and say \u201cI didn\u2019t wear the wrist braces when I slept, and I\u2019m still gaming 18 hours a day.\u201d Your GP would say go away, come back when you\u2019ve tried what I suggested, and THEN we\u2019ll see if you need a referral to physio/specialists etc etc.\n\nYou could absolutely not call a surgeon to ask them directly about surgery. Honestly as a British person that sounds WILD to me!! You couldn\u2019t even self refer to their clinic within the hospital tbh, you\u2019d have to go back to your GP and do it that way.\n\nIf you go to A&amp;E (aka ER) or a \u2018walk in clinic\u2019 (which are for non life threatening medical stuff which still needs immediate attention) you will be asked for your GP\u2019s name &amp; their office address, so that the details of your treatment there can be sent back to your GP and added to your medical records. A&amp;E and walk in clinics can refer you on to other departments (ie. you\u2019ve come in with a broken hand, they\u2019ll get you an x-Ray, then get you fixed up). They\u2019ll also work with your GP to find you further less immediate care (your broken hand will need physio once it\u2019s healed, they\u2019ll pass on paperwork back to your GP to set this in motion). \n\nYour paperwork is centralised, and theoretically there for a life time. Whenever you\u2019re referred onwards you agree to that information being shared with the new set of doctors &amp; their department. Which is why I imagine someone like Nina is finding it hard to get the treatment she\u2019s demanding. There\u2019ll be paperwork saying \u201cshe does not have this thing, I\u2019ve recommended she get therapy\u201d and the next doctor who looks through the file will see it and see what tests they did, and probably come to the same conclusion.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect obviously! Paperwork gets lost, doctors are too busy to look through it properly, munchies can be convincing actors, etc etc. But I do imagine why there are less full-on full-drama munchies in the U.K. as it\u2019s a totally different system.\n\nThis is of course, only for going through the NHS. You can pay for private healthcare and the system is similar but not the same as the US one, I believe. There are definitely different meds available private (ie. the NHS does not ever prescribe xanax, it is only available for private patients), and they can do all the woo treatments munchies love. \n\nQuick side note in the interest of being thorough: there are some departments you can self refer to! Sexual health clinics (which screen for STIs and provide contraception) allow you to self refer and won\u2019t share your information with your GP unless you want them to. There are some clinics like hearing clinics where you can call up and be seen. Same with travel vaxx departments. They will tho all ask if they can share the info with your GP, and most people say yes. \n\nAgain SORRY FOR THE ESSAY!!!", "score": 5, "subreddit": "illnessfakersgonewild"}

{"comment": "Holy crap! Thank you for the info! It sounds like the UK and US system both have their own benefits and problems, plus the standard issues in any healthcare system like lost paperwork and slow referrals. \n\nOverall, it seems you all have a slightly more formalized flowchart process for referrals and more intensive treatment, but the process is much the same. Here, though, some GPs (called PCPs here) are willing to handle a lot more in their offices, while others will immediately send out a referral even for very simple things. One good example is the treatment of ADHD in kids. This is a condition that pediatricians have learned to diagnose and treat, but do so to varying degrees. Some will start Adderall (amphetamine) or Ritalin (methylphenidate) and work with them to find the right medication, while others will require they have a full evaluation from a psychologist before they\u2019ll even consider referring them to a psychiatrist to start medication. There\u2019s no standardization! \n\nI should say that it\u2019s not always possible for someone to just call up a surgeon\u2019s clinic and get an appointment or surgery, but it often is! Especially for things like orthopedic or GI issues. Of course, if you needed an emergency surgery or anything like that you would always be able to get that whether or not you had a referral. \n\nIt makes sense that you can seek care at an STD or travel vaxx clinic without a referral, though it really only benefits the patient to share that information! In the US, most (or maybe all) states have computerized systems to track everyone\u2019s vaccinations, though I\u2019m not aware of anything at a national level. Some state governments are starting to pass loophole laws that allow patients to \u201copt out\u201d of these programs in the name of privacy.

Another way to counter heavy is using the Vaccinator. Bullet resisitance is OP, and Vaxx ubers build quickly, so you can easily take out that Heavy with a teammate. Also, a competent sniper can prescope and hit the heavy, if the heavy isn't watching for a sniper actively. If a soldier or scout will spam at the Heavy from a different location, he'll distract the heavy long enough for the sniper to get a good shot in (Again, Teamwork). Spy won't die instantly if he uses deadringer or Kunai, both of which increase his lifespan. Engineer could build a sentry, if his team actually defends him (again, teamwork!).

She talked badly about her mother, raised her voice at her and slammed doors while her mother was talking. To be fair, her mother had some severe mental issues, but she was overly mean to her. She had nearly no friends and I slowly noticed it was because of her behaviour. She was mean, unforgiving, tried to correct people (which is good!), but did it in such a unmerciful way. She often had different opinions than I had, after a couple of months she started to insist on making hijra, which we never talked about, when we met and talked. She was super anti vaxx and thought the government wants to kill everbody. She didnt even drink tap water, because she said its poisoned with fluorid. Besides that, I snore and she started to KICK me awake when I did that. Once she slapped me in public (which only happened once), it was on our way to tarawih. I slowly started to get more and more frustrated, started go not see her (we didnt live together). We were texting and she said \"divorce me, divorce me\" in a fight, which I then did. In her Iddah I was once at her home (she greeted me with \"you look so ugly\", as I had cut my hair). We called a couple of times and texted here and there. She wanted to get back, but I was so fed up. I didnt want my kids to be like her! The last time we spoke she said herself she is a sociopath and drove me away by herself. Her one friend also told her that. We both pray 5 times a day, fast and even visited a scholar weekly. My friends and the scholar told me to really think about going on with it, the scholar even said, that this realtionship is toxic and not healthy for me anymore. We married when I was 18 and she was 23. The marriage lasted a year and a couple of months.\n\n\nConclusion: learn about her friends, get to know her family, ask around who knows her and how she is. You need to find out who she really is. When you sit together with her parents, you will only see the best of her. Look for red flags and dont be too afraid to say no, even if you think you cant live anymore without a spouse.

Your issue is this, and maybe more that you haven't expanded on, but society doesn't care at all about your issue. They don't mind the idea of some unnamed person being taken away to be forced to follow the law. That's something that bothers me about it. I don't believe they ever do the proper testing if you just look at lack of placebo studies and burial/censorship of any condemning studies.\nBut if people are willing to call a hotline for their neighbors who dared to leave a lock down for some fresh air or a church service or whatever, they'll be willing to do the same against the religious family next door that has all unvaxxed healthy kids playing with their own vaxxed kids.

The percentage of the herd that needs to be immune varies from disease to disease and from species to species. \n\nHow you get to herd immunity is another matter. The only way is not to let it rip through the population. People seem to attach negative connotations to the phrase herd immunity simply because of the original plan in the UK. To make it very clear, we will reach herd immunity at some point, the alternative is we are fighting this disease for the rest of our lives. You can get to herd immunity via vaccines. Herd immunity unfortunately gives anti vaxxers a bit of a platform - we didn\u2019t vaccinate our kids and they are fine! Yeah, because everyone else does so your kid doesn\u2019t meet anyone else with whatever you didn\u2019t vaccinate them to. We then have issues when too many people don\u2019t vax and we end up below the herd immunity threshold.", "score": 8, "subreddit": "AskReddit"}

However those are same people that would be into just ERP or actual sex or just as well standard non-erotic RP. Mixing ERP into RPG is a result of overlapping relation zones, not means to get them to overlap.\n\nRest of the comment is just braindump.\n\nSure, if you feel there might be something, give PCs an option to opt-in, but like with the first kiss thing, only go 80%, and be prepared to quickly turn another corner if you see ABORT MISSION flashing. And I\u2019d reverse that and start with 20% and let players go the extra 80% if they feel comfortable.\n\nI think it\u2019s not hard to gauge players reactions. And I mean ALL players. If something more risqu\u00e9 appears in the player\u2019s RP, but another player seems uncomfortable, if their character is trying to turn the course of this ship elsewhere, if they I dunno, declare their character is shocked and leaves, then you \u201ccut to black\u201d like in a PG-13 movie, everything above leaves as implied.\n\nNot to abuse the mainstay of any online D&amp;D discussions, but it is a great example:\n\nCritical Role Campaign 1 spoilers below.\n\nThe famous scene where Percy talks with Vax in the bathroom, and Vex is where she is. Everything is implied, the show is generally rated R, but everyone was comfortable with a specific level of explicit content: the characters are interacting in a sexual manner, but they don\u2019t play it out.\n\nFor some groups even that might be too much, for others it might be not enough, but it has to be a \u201clowest common denominator\u201d. You make your campaign only as WHATEVER (risqu\u00e9, gory, tragic, brutal) as the least comfortable party member allows. \n\nIn case you have a majority that has much different expectations than the minority, they might want to split it, or the minority might want to look elsewhere. It is not a bad thing. We had a pacifist hemophobic bard leave, because every other PC preferred fighting than negotiating. Just what the large majority wanted the campaign to be, and no one was angry about the end result. And same players are now playing basically combat averse PCs in a different campaign, because that\u2019s the party we created.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "rpghorrorstories"}

The spirit in the skull was the trapped soul of a Gith... I don't remember if he was Githyanki or Githrazei, but one of them, a pirate from the Astral Sea, and he was straight lying to Grog. If the skull had been successfully smashed the Gith's soul would have taken over Grog's body and fled off the plane back to the Astral Sea. Forcing Travis to reroll a new, at least temporary, character until they could capture the Pirate and force him out of Grog's body (and it would be up to them if that was an immediate thing or if they felt they had to wait until the Conclave was dealt with).", "score": 6, "subreddit": "criticalrole"}

It doesn\u2019t mean you love her less, it means you\u2019re putting your well being first. If she can\u2019t understand that, it\u2019s on her and not you. If she starts to talk about them, kindly remind her of your boundary. If she still violates it, you are free to leave the room/hang up the phone, whatever it is that ends the interaction. She can\u2019t expect you to accept her friends, you very clearly said no and that\u2019s it.\n\nI may be able to give insight from the other side- I have a guy and a girl friend, both of whom my boyfriend absolutely despise. He doesn\u2019t expect me to get rid of them, but he hates them for sure. I was friends with them before I met him, and have known them for a couple years. Everyone has their own criteria for relationships- it\u2019s hard to cut someone off when you work with them too. Each of them have traits I dislike- the guy is honestly your classic self absorbed type, can be objective towards women and generally full of himself. The girl friend I have is loud, pushy and has a tendency to be kind of standoffish. She confessed to me once she was sleeping with a married man and all I could do was tell her it was extremely wrong- I can\u2019t control her behavior. It bothers me of course, but they\u2019ve also been *friends* to me. The guy helped me learn guitar and he\u2019s the only one I can talk politics with civilly. The girl came immediately when I was hospitalized last fall and helped me out when I was facing eviction and had nobody else. \n\nI respect the fact my boyfriend doesn\u2019t like them and I don\u2019t expect him to hang out with them or listen to me talk about them, but the only reason for that is because he told me- so definitely talk to your girlfriend about it! The whole \u201csimilar people\u201d thing isn\u2019t always true. I\u2019d describe myself as more introverted, less impulsive, etc. Their personalities and values aren\u2019t the same as mine but they\u2019re still people I enjoy despite certain shortcomings. I have an anti vaxx friend and I\u2019m sure she thinks I\u2019m a moron for valuing medicine, but we make it work. She might have the same mentality I do, which is that you can\u2019t control others. Her criteria for friendships might be more lax, personally I don\u2019t cut a friend off unless they\u2019re actively hurting me or someone I care about. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna get the classic \u201cdump her\u201d comments but I\u2019d recommend trying to work this out first. I\u2019m sure if she ever changes jobs the friendships might wane too. I hate some of my coworkers and am indifferent towards others but I\u2019m friendly with them and hang out with them because I don\u2019t have any other choice, it\u2019s a small business and I see them constantly.

So now I probably won\u2019t meet her in person until New Years or sometime next year, maybe Easter not sure. What I do know about her, and the conversations she\u2019s had with me and my fianc\u00e9, is that she\u2019s become anti-vax within the last 5 years.

Like telling us not to make her a grandmother until we\u2019re married (even if she didn\u2019t say that, we agreed not to have kids until we were married and had our own house. Currently we live with my parents). She also tells my fianc\u00e9 that he should reach out to his youngest brother and that his brother \u201cmisses him so much\u201d. They haven\u2019t seen each other in over 7 months. She kept saying it so often, at least 3 times on that call that I spoke up and told her communication goes both ways and his brother is old enough to reach out too. I don\u2019t agree with the way she speaks to my fianc\u00e9 because she\u2019s always condescending and demanding of him. Despite the fact that he\u2019s an adult, moved out on his own to a different state months ago and has been doing well on his own so far.

Go watch The Portal on youtube.\n\nThis is a shit source, anti vax morons and conspiracy theorists get most of their propaganda from youtube and point to it when you ask them where they get their information from. \n\n&gt;But aside from that, I don't really particularly care if you believe me or not on the charge about the Dems. I just want you to think about the simple thing I said. Don't trust authority unless you know how it functions enough to do so. You have no idea how any authority you trust functions. So you should be skeptical about all of it. If you disagree with me on that point, then I advise you to think harder on it. It's a very simple thought experiment that should get you there, namely: \"Why the fuck would you trust anything or anyone with power that you don't know the way in which they are using it?\".\n\nGot it, ill just think harder and come to the right conclusion.\n\n&gt;My premise is very simple, really. You trust authority more than you should, because of the simple fact that I know enough about whichever kind you would speak of that is actually relevant in the world to know it does not operate with enough transparency. You'll say, well here, I have a very clear thing to show from the GOP. Yeah, I'd like to hear what that clear thing is. Go ahead.\n\nYour entire comment is incoherent and you seem to think you're smarter than you actually are. You wrote a lot but didnt say anything of substance.

On this same token, it also can allow you some spare AP to crouch your stance in the event that cover isn't feasible to squeak out that extra 10% hit chance you'd get from cover.\n\nAlso, a limited amount of AP can carry over to your squad mates next turn: this means that the spare AP from the last turn could mean a second shot, or that extra few meters you need to get into a flanking position for that much needed take down. As you progress further into the game elevation becomes both a boon and a bane; those extra AP could mean the difference of a round before you get your squad where you need them to be for a tactical advantage.\n\n In summary of that last bit: Sometimes spending that extra AP to tweak position after a shot isn't to your benefit.

Being anti vax isn\u2019t the only problem, a lot of people are also vaccine hesitant for the same reasons you describe. \n\nEverybody knows somebody who \u201cgot a little sick\u201d because of a vaccine. Everybody knows some story of a person who suffered some strange side effect as a result of a vaccine. People, not truly understanding vaccine medicine, then connect the dots in a way that makes sense to them, but fails to account for the bigger picture. \n\nThe best course of action regarding vaccines is to just listen to your doctor and follow the regular vaccination schedule. That\u2019s it. There is no conclusive evidence that any individual vaccines have a significant risk of causing any harm, and no evidence to suggest that taking multiple vaccines together causes any unnecessarily adverse reactions or complications. \n\nOf course people don\u2019t see the many situations where vaccines work just fine because nobody pays attention to, or goes around talking about, their almost completely symptomless vaccination the other day. The human mind remembers the exceptional parts of our lives, not the stuff the barely affected us. For example, I can remember exactly how I received my acoustic guitar because of how negative an experience that was, even tough I got that guitar around 15 years ago when I was a child. I can remember telling my fourth grade teaching assistant \u201cmaybe you should go on a diet\u201d because I remember her breaking down and crying in class and then the embarrassment of being sent home with a teacher\u2019s not for what I did.

The days that go by where nothing happened. I remember almost none of the times I went to the doctor and they found nothing wrong. I remember almost nothing of the times I went to the dentist and they just did the standard \u201cyou\u2019re bleeding because you don\u2019t floss\u201d cleaning and I went on my merry way. I don\u2019t remember all of the times I received medication and it worked without complication. \n\nWhile I know you mean well, there is no \u201cmistake\u201d in taking vaccinations on schedule.

My MIL is anti vax because one out of 4 kids had a liver issue, instead of the doctor taking this into account before giving all vaccinations he just gave them all and my bil got very sick. MIL dragged this out! The dude is far in his 30s and is still considered as ''not able to care for himself'' He's naive and doesn't think before taking action but hey, most people are like that.\n\nI once started the discussion with her, that one doctor made a mistake, not all doctors, BIL getting sick from ONE single vaccine doesn't mean that vaccine is bad or all of them are bad, that vaccine just shouldn't have been given to him. That moment she said I was correct but of course she forgot that by next week when SIL bought a new dog. An Australian breed which she of course had to vaccinate, MIL called her up and tried to tell her vaccines are bad for everything that lives and to press it on her heart to not vaccinate her poor new pup. \n\nSIL fucking queen she is, told her she couldn't expect her to get a dog from the other side of the world, who wasn't used to our canine diseases, to not give them vaccines and just shut up about it.\n\nAfter that screaming match I got home, MIL knows BF and I eventually want kids and asked me if I was going to vaccinate her future grandchildren because that would break her heart.\n\nI said yes, MIL we talked about this last week, vaccines aren't bad, I will vaccinate the shit out of every vaccinate-able living thing that comes into my care and your emotional bullshit isn't going to change that. Just shut up and stop making yourself pissed.\n\nShit hit the fucking fan that week but I am not backing down because of her emotion. If we lived like she wanted the world to live we would all get the exact same pay for different jobs and abilities, so if I work 1 hour a week sweeping the floor I should get the exact same salary as a doctor working 60 hours a week or any other job. This lady does not understand the flaw in that logic. FIL is not much better, he just doesn't pick fights until you agree with him. MIL seems to think her opinion is the constitution and if you have even a slightly different opinion than her, you probably think she is retarded and an idiot.\n\nI mean I do think she doesn't know the difference between actual logic and emotions but I never told her that. \n\nSorry for the rant, MIL really does get to me. Mostly because I studied laboratory sciences and have had in dept explanation about vaccinations and medicine while studying bacteria, viruses and chemicals. because I did allround and had teachers that really wanted us to know EVERYTHING.\n\n Bitch started telling me antibiotics are for viruses. \n\nThat's when I refused to discuss and said: ''I was taught at school antibiotics are for bacteria and vaccines are for viruses.'' and left.\n\n half an hour later she came to me and said, ''even though I didn't appreciate how you told me, I think you are right that antibiotics are for bacteria.''\n\nSo I sighed and said: ''mil, I don't appreciate how you try to force your opinions on us like facts but usually I have to deal with it too, so you can deal with this. I know what I studied and can go get my old college books if you ever want to read up. Have a nice evening.''\n\nGheeze I digress. The lady really gets to me.
